<p class="indent4"><i><span class="smcap">Sire</span></i>,</p>

<p><i>The countenance of an enlightened Prince has ever
been eagerly sought after by the most distinguished
authors. It may then well be permitted to an humble
admirer and translator of a poem of Denmark’s greatest
Scald to desire to place himself and his work under
the protection of a King of Denmark, who yields to no
Sovereign of any age or country in his love of science,
and in his zealous furtherance of all that can adorn
or benefit the great family of mankind. In soliciting
the permission of dedicating this work to your Majesty,
I had nothing to plead in favour of my request, but
my ardent zeal for Scandinavian literature; I knew,
however, that such zeal would be my greatest recommendation
in the eyes of a patriotic Monarch, and the
gracious permission accorded to me by Your Majesty
I consider as my highest reward.</i></p>

<h2>PREFACE<br />
<span class="smaller">BY THE TRANSLATOR.</span></h2>

<p>The argument of the poem by the author is the sole
document that accompanies the original work; there
are neither notes nor preface to the edition from which
I have made my translation, and which is the only one
I have ever seen. To the people of education in Scandinavia,
who are well versed in the ancient mythology of
their country, notes are perhaps not strictly necessary,
inasmuch as this poem is based upon the Edda, which
is universally read; but since, to the generality of
English readers, the Edda and the Scandinavian mythology
are but little, if at all familiar, I feel myself
bound to furnish them with all the information on the
subject that I have been able to collect from various
sources; by which they will be enabled to read this
poem with additional pleasure and profit.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian mythology, like that of all other
nations, is founded on the personification and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
consequent adoration of the powers of nature, which may
be expressed by the word “Demonism,” used in its
Greek sense; to this may be added the deification of
national heroes.</p>

<p>The first source of Demonism (I here borrow the
words of Wieland in his admirable work called Agathodemon)
lies in the ignorance of mankind, in the early
stages of the world, of the real causes or laws by
which the powers of nature act, on the one side; and
on the other, in the innate propensity of man to reflect
the image of the things which he can and does see, on
the things which lie beyond the contact of his senses.</p>

<p>This induces us to personify the causes of the effects
that we behold in nature; we assign to them our
manner of thinking and acting, and we endow them
with a form like our own, because we can conceive no
higher model. Thus we give a supposed existence to
an infinite number of divinities in heaven and earth,
whose operations are seen and felt, though the agents
themselves are unseen or unknown. Thus the earth,
the sun, the moon, the stars, the sea, rivers, woods,
mountains, etc., all have their peculiar divinities; and
as these were considered as the cause of light or of
darkness, of warmth or of cold, of fertility or of barrenness,
of the eternal vicissitudes of the year, month or
day, as well as of the destructive effects of storms, tempests,
floods, volcanoes, earthquakes, etc., to the idea
of their existence became conjoined the belief of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
superhuman power. They were therefore recognised
as the arbitrary rulers of nature, who had their separate
principalities, circles, and districts in her empire; and
as we ascribe to them our own passions, caprices,
and necessities, we naturally endeavour to captivate
their good will, or avert their anger, by prayers, sacrifices,
presents, or penances.</p>

<p>On the principle of Demonism, therefore, did the
earliest legislators establish the basis of their fabric of
social order, civilization and religion; and it was by
profiting by this innate inclination of mankind, that
priests and mystagogues succeeded in consolidating
their power and influence, which became necessarily
augmented and enhanced by the right they arrogated
to themselves of canonizing or deifying those heroes or
princes, whom they were disposed to hold up as worthy
of adoration, or as examples to be followed by the
people.</p>

<p>History thus became blended with allegory and mythology;
and this circumstance, combined with the
total want of chronology, which seems to pervade the
early records of all nations, renders it extremely difficult
to give to any mythology a consistent form, proportionate
in all its parts, and presenting an invariable
doctrine or system of action.</p>

<p>Proceeding thus from a similar source, the Scandinavian
polytheism has a remarkable coincidence with
those of Greece, Italy, Egypt and India; and from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
classification of the superior powers into good and evil
genii, it bears a still more striking resemblance to the
religion of the ancient Persians, the doctrine of the
Magi, which admits the co-existence of, and the eternal
struggle between, the two opposing principles of Good
and Evil, under the types of Ormuzd and Ahrimanes.</p>

<p>It seems generally admitted that the Gothic mythology
was introduced into the north-west of Europe by the
Asar or Asiatic Goths, when, under the guidance of the
historical Odin, they emigrated from the borders of the
Black Sea and penetrated into Scandinavia, where they
founded their empire; and had they at that time been
acquainted with navigation, they would most assuredly
not have stopped there, but would have invaded the
British Islands, which would have afforded an easy conquest,
and a more alluring resting-place, from the
superior fertility of their soil, and far greater mildness
of the climate.</p>

<p>The word <i>Asa</i> may be derived from Asia, or both
may be derived from the word As or Az,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which in the
Zend or ancient Persian dialect (the link between the
Gothic and the Sanscrit) signifies “powerful, elevated;”
and may have been applied to that part of Asia bordering
on Europe by its own inhabitants, as a country, <i>par
excellence</i>, occupied by a super-excellent people; on the
same principle that the word “Svensk” (Swedish) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
derived from “Sven” (man), and denotes a man, <i>par
excellence</i>; and the country itself called “<i>Sverige</i>”
(empire of men, Sweden). The word Goth also is a
synonyme for what is good, great, and illustrious; for
in all the Teutonic and Scandinavian languages, the
three words <i>Goth</i>, <i>good</i>, and <i>God</i> spring from the same
root; such has ever been the self-love and vanity of
nations. The term <i>Jotun</i> or <i>Jette</i> may on the other
hand have been the name of some rival nation, professing
a different worship, and engaged in a long and
obstinate warfare with the Asar or Goths, either in
Asia or in Europe; and by the suggestion of national
hatred, the Asar may have given the name of their enemies
(the Jetter) to the destructive powers of nature,
personified by the malevolent genii or giants: hence in
the Icelandic, Danish and Swedish languages, the term
Jotun, Jette, or Jätte, denotes a giant and implies the
idea formed of this fabulous race by all nations.</p>

<p>The historical Odin was deified after his death, as
were his wives, his sons, and immediate relations, and
either their names may have been given to the benign
influences of nature, or they (Odin and his relations)
may have adopted the names of the gods of their Asiatic
ancestors, in order to impose on their new subjects.
The names of regions, places and abodes were transferred
from Asia to Scandinavia; and the said names were,
either previously or subsequently to the first grand immigration
of the Goths into the north-west of Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
applied by them to the supposed residences of the gods
in heaven. Among the Egyptians and Greeks, the
names of the Zodiac and of the constellations afford a
similar and satisfactory proof of the continual re-action
of earth on heaven, and of heaven on earth.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The popular belief of the continual intercourse between
heaven and earth, between gods, demi-gods,
and heroes in the early ages of mankind, fostered and
encouraged by the many ingenious allegories framed by
the priests, the sole astronomers of the time, out of the
movements and influences of the celestial bodies, render
either hypothesis probable, and may serve to account
for the many incongruities that prevail in the Scandinavian,
as well as in other mythologies; it is sufficient
for the comprehension of this poem, to lay down the
principle, that the Asar (gods) represent the <i>creating</i>,
<i>embellishing</i>, and <i>conservative</i> powers of nature; and
the Jetter (giants), on the contrary, represent the <i>defacing</i>,
<i>corrupting</i>, <i>destructive</i> powers of the same. The
giants existed before the gods, inasmuch as <i>chaos</i>,
<i>darkness</i> and <i>confusion</i> preceded <i>creation</i>, <i>light</i> and
<i>order</i>.</p>

<p>With respect to the superhuman size attributed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
most nations to evil spirits, it may be observed, that in
darkness the terrors of mankind increase, and the shades
of night magnify considerably to the visual orb every
object in nature: hence to the Jetter, or evil genii, who
were supposed to wander about at night doing mischief,
was lent by the imagination a form gigantic in stature,
and features frightful to behold. Day appears! the
giants vanish! or they assume the ordinary appearance
of towers, steeples, and windmills; or they become
changed to wolves and bears; or they dwindle to the
usual human size: but are still dangerous by their
knowledge of magic, their power of effecting transformations,
and by the artifices and illusions whereby they
seek to mislead mankind and seduce them to the perpetration
of evil. That the Jotun or Jetter, who were
probably the aboriginal inhabitants of Scandinavia at
the time of the Gothic invasion, should appear to the
Asar to be giants in size, and as having the heads of
bears, wolves, elks, or wild bulls, conjoined to human
bodies, may be very easily and naturally accounted for.
The Jotun race were in a very low state of civilization
compared with the Asar, and were, probably, totally
unacquainted with the art of tanning or weaving. They
accordingly clothed themselves with the skins of beasts;
and in order to increase the terrific in their exterior
(an object of great importance among savage nations),
they preserved the head, tail, and claws of the animals,
in whose spoils they arrayed themselves; and wore its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
head, horns and all, as a head-dress above their own,
allowing the tail to dangle behind them, while its paws
crossed their breast. This must naturally have given to
them the appearance, not only of a stature far above the
human size, but that also of partaking of the shape and
nature both of man and beast, which idea was not a little
supported by the ferocity of their manners; and such
was probably the origin of giantism in every country.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>I shall now proceed to give an outline of the cosmogony
and principal events of the Scandinavian mythology,
as far as they can be collected from the only authentic
source extant, viz. the fragments of the poetry
contained in the elder or poetic Edda, discovered and
compiled by the celebrated Sæmund Sigfusson, a native
of Iceland, who was born in the year 1054, and died in
1133. He was a Christian priest of extensive talents
and acquirements, who made a journey to Rome, a rare
occurrence, at that time, among the clergy of the north.
He it was who discovered these fragments, and at once
perceived their value. He compiled them, and gave
them to light, with a Latin translation of his own,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
under the name of the Edda, which, in the Icelandic or
ancient Scandinavian tongue, means “Ancestress.”</p>

<p>It was fortunate that this discovery was made by a
man so enlightened and liberal as Sæmunder, who was
free from all the prejudices which prevailed among
the clergy of his time. Any poem or writing connected
with the ancient polytheistic religion of the country,
was at that time considered as the work of devils, and
severely proscribed. The poems of the Edda, therefore,
had they fallen into the hands of an ignorant or bigotted
priest, would have been burnt, and lost to posterity for
ever. The fragments thus collected together under the
name of the Edda are, indeed, but the <i>disjectorum
membra poetarum</i>; but they form the only document
extant, which throws on the Scandinavian mythology a
light at all to be depended on.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Of importance far inferior, but still of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
relative utility, is the younger or prosaic Edda, composed,
rather than compiled, by Snorro Storleson, a
learned Icelander, who was born in 1178, and was
killed at Reykiaholt in 1241. This work, written in
prose, may be considered as a commentary on the elder
or poetic Edda, with several additions and legends, collected
probably from oral tradition. It is written in a
homely, story-telling style, and but for the elder Edda,
would stand a chance of being considered as unimportant
as a black letter romaunt or fairy tale. In the preface
to it, there is a strange jumble of history, sacred
and profane; a very fantastic geography; and an attempt
to derive the genealogy of all the nations in Europe
from the Trojans: there reigns, moreover, throughout
the whole work, a total want of chronology.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The most interesting part of the work, from the light
it throws on the elder Edda, is the Gyllfaginning, or
Conversations of King Gyllfe, who reigned over a part
of Sweden at the time of Odin’s invasion. A curious
appendage to the work is the “Skalde sprâket” (the
language of the Skalds), which forms a sort of <i>Gradus
ad Parnassum</i> of the Icelandic poetry, in which the
synonymes and epithets of all persons and things occurring
in the works of the Skalds, are given with extreme
accuracy. But, as I have before stated, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
importance of Snorro Sturleson’s work is derived from
the elder or poetic Edda. In the Gyllfaginning occurs
the following remarkable passage:</p>

<p>“King Gyllfe was a prudent and very wise man; it
caused him much surprize that the Asar possessed so
much knowledge, that every thing yielded to their
will; and he reflected whether this could proceed
from their own power, or whether they derived it
from the Gods, to whom they sacrificed.”</p>

<p>It is from the Gyllfaginning that I borrow the following
account of the cosmogony, according to the
Scandinavian mythology.</p>

<p>In the beginning when nothing existed, when there
was neither earth, nor sea, nor heaven, all was Ginnungagap,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
a vast unfathomable abyss. Towards the
north of this abyss lay a world of cold and darkness
called Niffelheim, in the midst of which was the source
or fountain Hvergelmer. On the south of Ginnungagap
lay Muspelheim, a world of heat, light and fire. From
the source Hvergelmer flowed twelve rivers, called collectively
Elivagor. These flowed into Ginnungagap,
so far from their source, that the poisonous matter
they contained congealed at length, and formed a mass
of ice. On the other hand, the sparks and flames proceeding
from Muspelheim, came into contact with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
congealed mass; and the heat, operating on the cold,
produced the giant Ymer, the grand progenitor of the
race of giants. He was wicked, and so were all his
race, who were called Hrimthusser. Shortly after the
apparition of Ymer, arose the cow Audumbla; she
nourished herself by licking the frost from the pillars of
salt in Ginnungagap; and this operation produced, on
the first day, a man’s hair; on the second, his whole
head; on the third the entire man; this man was called
Bure. Bure had a son called Bor; and this Bor, by
an union with a beautiful giantess of the name of
Betsla, became the father of three sons, Odin, Vil and
Ve, the progenitors of the Asar race. These three
brothers slew the giant Ymer, from whose body flowed
so much blood, that all the giants were drowned therein,
except Bergelmer and his wife, who escaped from the
deluge on the top of a mountain. Bergelmer and his
wife had a numerous progeny, and by them were perpetuated
the giant race. Odin, Vil and Ve, having
slain Ymer, proceeded to the creation of the world, as it
now exists. From the limbs of Ymer, they created the
earth, the mountains from his bones, the sea from his
blood, the heavens from his scull; and from his eye-brows
they built Midgard, name of the abode to be inhabited
by the human race, and so called, because it
lies in the middle region. They then from two trees,
which they found on the sea-shore, created a man,
called Askur, and a woman called Embla; and placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
them to dwell in Midgard. From this pair descend all
mankind.</p>

<p>On the confines of Midgard towards the north, and
separated from it by mountains of ice and snow, and
dreary wastes eternally agitated by storms, lies Utgard,
the domain of the giants, whose sovereign is Lok, commonly
called Utgard-Lok, to distinguish him from an
Asa bearing the same name. Utgard became thus the
region assigned to the giant race, as Midgard was to
mankind. The Asar chose for themselves a region
supposed to be in the heavens above the earth, and this
region they called Asagard. There they built for themselves
various palaces and tenements; and dwelling
therein, pass their time in joy and felicity, in banquets,
tournaments, festivals, and amusements of all sorts;
or they occupy themselves in conferring happiness
upon, and imagining inventions useful and beneficial
to the human race. They occasionally descend from
Asagard to Midgard, by passing over the bridge Bifrost,
when they deem it necessary to intervene immediately
in the affairs of mankind, for the purpose of relieving
the oppressed, or of enforcing the practice of justice and
benevolence.</p>

<p>The giants, on the contrary, when they sally forth
from their domain in Utgard, do so for the purpose of
creating storms and earthquakes, and causing, either
openly or insidiously, as much mischief as possible to
gods and men.</p>

<p>I shall not in this preface enumerate the names of
the different gods and goddesses, nor of their abodes
and attributes; neither shall I enumerate the names of
the giants, nor those of the Dvergar, of the Alfer, or of
the Vaner. All these names will be found in a catalogue,
alphabetically arranged, which I shall annex to
this work. Neither shall I take notice, in this preface,
of the various episodes of the mythology, which are
introduced in the body of the poem, and explain themselves;
but I shall proceed to give an account of the
death of Balder,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> as it is related in the younger or
prosaic Edda.</p>

<p>Frigga is the wife of Odin and queen of the gods.
Their son Balder, the most benevolent among the Asar,
called by the Skalds “the fillet that binds together the
garland of the gods,” was troubled with unpleasant
dreams, portending some dreadful calamity to himself,
and pregnant with mischief and ruin to the universe.
He related his dreams to the Asar, and a council was
held by them, in order to devise the means of averting
the threatened mischief. His mother Frigga exacted
an oath from all the elements, from iron and all kinds
of metals, from stones, trees, beasts, birds, fishes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
reptiles, that they would do no injury to Balder. When
this oath was made, it was agreed upon by the Asar,
that they should throw their lances at Balder, or cut at
him with their swords, by way of amusement and experiment.
Of course, enchanted as he was, he remained
unscathed from all those assaults. This rejoiced the
gods exceedingly; but there was one among the Asar,
called Lok, originally of giant race, but admitted among
the gods; a being of a treacherous and vacillating disposition,
addicted to mockery and calumny, and inheriting
from his ancestors, the giants, a strong innate
disposition to mischief. It grieved him sore, that no
injury could be done to Balder. He repaired to Fensal,
the abode of Frigga, in the shape of a female, and related
to her what had past between Balder and the
other Asar at the tournament. Frigga replied: No
weapon can do injury to Balder, for I have exacted an
oath in his favour from all things likely to do him mischief.
Lok answered: Have you really exacted an oath
from all things? Frigga replied: Eastward to Valhalla
grows a little plant, called the mistletoe; from it I
exacted no oath, for it appeared to me so insignificant,
as to be incapable of doing harm to anybody. Lok
went away, dug up the plant, and made thereof a
spear; he then went in search of Hædur, twin-brother
of Balder, and born blind. Having found him, he
asked him, why he did not join in the general amusement,
and cast a weapon at Balder. Hædur replied:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
I am blind, and have no weapon. Lok answered:
You should not be the only one among the Asar, who
does not do honour to Balder; here! take this lance
(giving to him the spear made of the mistletoe), and run
at him with it! Hædur did so, and Balder fell down
dead. The gods were inconsolable at his loss, and sent
Hermod, the messenger of Odin, to Hela, the queen of
death and of the shades below, into whose hands Balder
had fallen, in order to supplicate his release. Hermod
mounted the steed of Odin, called Sleipner, and repaired
to the abode of Hela, in order to demand the
restitution of Balder. Hela at first refused to release
him on any condition whatsoever; but at length relenting,
she said: Now is the time to prove, if Balder be
really so beloved by all creatures, as ye pretend. If,
therefore, every thing in nature will shed tears for
Balder’s death, and demand his release, I will grant it.
Hermod returned to Asagard, satisfied with the success
of his mission. The Asar sent messengers all over the
earth, calling upon all creatures to weep for Balder’s
death; and all creatures did grieve and join in the
prayer for his release from the shades of Helheim,
except an old witch, by name Thock, who was sitting
by the entrance of a cavern. When called upon to
join in the general lamentation, she answered spitefully:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">With dry tears</div>
<div class="verse">Doth Thock grieve</div>
<div class="verse">For the death of Balder;</div>
<div class="verse">He never did good to me</div>
<div class="verse">Either in life or death;</div>
<div class="verse">May Hela retain her prey!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in consequence of this solitary refusal, Hela did
retain her prey, and will do so until the end of time.
It was now discovered that the witch Thock was no
other than Lok himself in disguise; and the gods, enraged
at his treachery, inflicted on him a summary
vengeance. Changing his two sons into wolves, who
devour each other, the gods make a chain from their
intestines, and bind therewith Lok to a sharp rock in a
subterranean abode. They then place over him two
enormous serpents, who drop their venom on his limbs,
and he is to remain exposed to this continual torture
until the end of the world. But though Lok be thus
punished, the calamity springing from Balder’s death
cannot be averted; from it dates the entrance of crime
and misery into the world, and a state of unceasing
warfare in the heavens, on the earth, and under the
earth; which state is to last until the great day of
Ragnarok, called the twilight of the gods. On that
awful day, which is to be preceded by a severe uninterrupted
winter of three years’ duration, a great battle
is to be fought between the gods and giants, in which
dreadful conflict giants, gods, mankind, the whole
universe, in fine, are to perish in a shower of fire and
blood. After the destruction of the world, a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
creation is to take place under the auspices of Vidar,
the god of silence and wisdom, the sole being who survives
the general conflagration. It is he who is to
resuscitate the gods and the human race, and to lead
them to dwell in the palace of Gimle on the plains of
Ida, an abode of eternal joy and felicity, where virtue
and love are to reign triumphant, and vice and hatred
be extinguished for ever. As the details of the destruction
of the world and of its reconstruction are given in
the last canto of this poem, I need not dwell on them
here.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Besides the alphabetical catalogue, explicatory
of all that remains to be known, concerning the events
and personages which figure in this poem, I have annexed
to each canto notes, which give the hidden sense
and meaning of most of the mythes and allegories; on
which subjects I have borrowed all my information
from the celebrated Danish antiquarian Finn Magnussen,
now living in Copenhagen, which information is to be
found in his two admirable works, the one called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
“The elder Edda, translated with copious notes and
illustrations;” the other, “The Edda doctrine explained
and elucidated.” These two works afford a
complete key to the mythes and allegories of the
Scandinavian mythology, intricate as it is; and armed
thus with his (Finn Magnussen’s) magic wand, I too
may fearlessly undertake the office of Hierophant.</p>

<p>With respect to this poem and its author,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> it has been
observed by a modern Danish writer of some eminence:
“There have been various poetical works in
all the northern languages based on the legends of
the Edda; but no author has woven thereof a whole,
nor has so happily and poetically embodied its genius,
mythes and transformations, as Œhlenschläger in
his celebrated poem, The Gods of the North.”</p>

<p>To me it seems that he has combined in an eminent
degree the peculiar excellences of three distinguished
poets, of three distinct ages, viz. those of Hesiod in his
Theogony, of Ovid in his Metamorphoses, and of Ariosto
in his Orlando Furioso. Œhlenschläger seems to possess
all the inexhaustible genius, fertility of invention,
playfulness, and sly, but not ill-natured, satire of the
bard of Ferrara:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Il grande che cantò le armi e gli amori.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of my translation, it befits not me to speak. Like
my archetype, I have adopted various metres for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
different cantos, not always the same as those of the
original; for I wished to take a freer scope, and not to
fetter myself by an invariable adoption of the self-same
metres, which would have been attended with great
difficulty, inasmuch as some of them are unsuitable to
the genius of the English language, which is far less
laconic than the Danish. I have likewise, in a few
instances, amplified my archetype, for I was determined
that nothing of his should be lost; yet I trust, that
even in those parts where I have most amplified, I
have never departed from the meaning and spirit of the
author. I can therefore never admit, that my translation,
though unshackled, should be termed “a free
one,” or <i>Bearbeitung</i>, as the Germans express it.</p>

<p>With respect to my qualifications as a translator,
they are as follows: from the early age of fifteen I
have been engaged in the acquisition of the language
and literature of Germany; for the last twelve years, I
have closely studied the Danish and Swedish languages,
and I have lately attempted the Icelandic.</p>

<p>About eight years ago, I made a summer tour in
Denmark and Sweden, and when at Copenhagen, I
became acquainted with Finn Magnussen, the celebrated
antiquarian, and with the poet Œhlenschläger
himself, most of whose works I had previously read
with unbounded admiration and delight, and among
which, this poem, “The Gods of the North,” had excited
my peculiar attention. Thus prepared, I determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
on undertaking a metrical version of the whole
of this work, one canto of which (the 12th) I had previously
translated, and published anonymously in a
Parisian weekly review, in 1835.</p>

<p>In my translation, I was further encouraged by the
idea that I was thereby contributing to spread among
my countrymen a taste for the mythology and general
literature of Scandinavia, which is capable of furnishing
to the painter or the sculptor a series of subjects
not less interesting than those derived from the classic
sources of Greece or Rome. I recommend, also, to the
attention of scholars, the study of the Danish and Swedish
languages, as the key to an historical literature
extremely rich and diversified, interesting to the readers
of every European nation, but more particularly so to the
English reader, who is desirous of forming an intimate
acquaintance with the <i>arcana</i> of his own language, and
with his own early history, laws, customs, manners,
and legends. The history of Denmark, Norway, and
Sweden is as captivating as a romance, and it presents
an astonishing variety of the most singular events,
which would afford admirable subjects for epic and dramatic
poetry, as well as for the historical novel. The
English reader will perceive, likewise, that the Scandinavian
mythology is the fountain head of many of the
most popular tales, legends, and ballads of his own
country. It will interest him to mark the effect of the
introduction of the Christian religion upon the Scandinavian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
polytheism, as therein he may trace the origin
of many of our own superstitions and fabulous traditions.
At the appearance of the Cross, the proud edifice
of Valhalla, not seldom, alas! polluted with human
gore, crumbles into dust. Asagard, with all its palaces
and gardens, dissolves in air! The mighty Odin himself,
the wise, the just, the beneficent Odin, degenerates
into a common-place demon, liable to be exorcised
by a parish priest. The Nornor, or Fates, the solemn,
majestic, and impartial Nornor, though stern, yet beautiful
to behold, become changed to disgusting and
wrinkled witches, and figure as such in the weird sisters
of Macbeth. The awful giants of Utgard sink into
the ogres of a fairy tale; Thor, deprived of his belt, his
hammer, his gauntlets, and his car, dwindles into Jack
the Giant-killer,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the familiar hero of our days of
childhood; and from the <i>graa gaas</i> (grey goose), a
name given to a collection of ancient legends in the Icelandic
tongue, from the circumstance of great longevity
being attributed to that bird, may be traced our old
nursery acquaintance and monitress, Mother Goose.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> I
have only to add, that I began the translation of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
poem towards the end of the year 1836, and finished it
in the autumn of 1837; but I was compelled by circumstances
to delay the publication of it until the present
year.</p>

connection with the Empire and the Church, this tongue became
gradually deteriorated by a mixture with the German;
and it is by this mixture with the German that the modern
Swedish and Danish languages are formed. Iceland having
been colonised by some Norwegian families previous to the
corruption of the language, has thus, from its insular position,
preserved the old language pure; and it is now called

<h2>ALPHABETICAL LIST<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE PROPER NAMES OCCURRING IN OR CONNECTED WITH
THE POEM ENTITLED “THE GODS OF THE NORTH.”</span></h2>

<p><i>With the assistance of Finn Magnussen’s work Eddalæren
(Doctrine of the Edda), I have composed the following
alphabetical list of the proper names which occur in this
poem, wherein the attributes of the several personages are
given, and which should be consulted whenever a proper
name occurs, since I have not thought it necessary to repeat
in the notes annexed to each canto what is already given in
this catalogue.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><b>ÆGIR</b> is the god of the sea, the Neptune of the Scandinavian
mythology. His dwelling was supposed to be on the island
of Hlesey, now called Lessoe, in the Cattegat. He is sometimes
called Hler Ægir. He is of a benevolent disposition;
but his consort Ran, who is of giant race, is otherwise.
The etymology of the name Ægir is from the Icelandic
verb <i>Ægi</i>, to liquify, inundate, etc.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ALFADER</b> (Father of all) a name given to Odin, as king of
gods and men. It is sometimes given to a supreme unknown
God, pre-existent and superior to Odin himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ALF</b>, plural <b>ALFER</b>, are inferior elementary divinities, divided
into two classes, viz. the white Alfer, or Alfs of light;
and the black Alfer, or Alfs of darkness. The white Alfer
are related to the Asar and Vaner, and are friendly to
mankind; they dwell with Balder in his palace of Breidablik.
The black Alfer are mischievously disposed: they
are connected with the Dvergar (dwarfs), and like them
they shun the light of day: they dwell in caverns and sally
out at night only. Our word <i>elf</i> is derived therefrom.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ANGURBOD</b>, name of a Jettinde (giantess), who, in consequence
of an amour with Asa-Lok, brought forth three
frightful offspring, viz. the wolf Fenris, the serpent Jormundgard,
commonly called the serpent of Midgard, and
Hela, queen of death and of the shades below. The word
<i>Angurbod</i> denotes “messenger of sorrow.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ARILD</b>, Arilds-tid (time of Arild). From <i>Arilds-time</i> is a
manner of reckoning among the Scandinavians, similar to
our expression from “Noah’s time.” It means the time
when mankind first learned the use of fire, and to have fixed
habitations. Etym.: <i>arne</i> (hearth), <i>ild</i> (fire), and <i>tid</i> (time).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ASA</b>, pl. <b>ASAR</b>, name given to the gods of the Scandinavian
mythology; the principal Asar are Odin, Thor, Frey,
Balder, Vidar, Ægir, etc. The word seems to be derived
from the word As or Az, which in the Zend or ancient
Persian language, which forms the link between the Gothic
dialect and the Sanscrit, means <i>elevated</i>, <i>powerful</i>, <i>sublime</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ASYNIA</b>, pl. <b>ASYNIOR</b>, name given to the goddesses;
the principal Asynior are Frigga, Freya, Iduna, Sif, Gefion,
Nanna, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ASAGARD</b>, or <b>ASGARD</b>, is the region, the peculiar territory
of the gods. It was supposed to be in the heavens above
the earth, and to contain many rich domains and splendid
buildings, inhabited by the different gods and goddesses.
The most remarkable are the palace of Odin, called Valaskialf;
the celebrated banqueting hall or pavilion, called
Valhalla: Vingolf the peculiar palace and rendezvous of
the Asynior, or goddesses: Trudvang, the domain of Thor:
Fensal, the palace of Frigga: Folkvang, that of Freya:
Breidablik, that of Balder, besides many others which are
given in alphabetical order. Geographically, Asagard or
Asgard was the name of a territory and city on the northern
border of the Black Sea, from whence the Asiatic
Goths originally came. The word <i>gaard</i> in Danish, <i>gard</i>
in Swedish, means a <i>walled or hedged inclosure</i>, and is the
root of the words <i>yard</i>, <i>court</i> and <i>garden</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ASH</b>, see the word Yggdrassil.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ASKUR</b> is the name of the first man: he and Embla, the first
woman, were fabricated from two trees by Bor and Bure;
according to others, by Odin, Vil and Ve. Askur and
Embla were then placed by their makers in Midgard, to
dwell therein, and perpetuate their race. Askur and
Embla are in fact the Adam and Eve of the Gothic mythology.
Etym.: <i>askr</i> (ash tree).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ASTRILD</b> is the god of love: his name is not to be found
in the Edda, but it appears in several of the old Sagas.
Etym.: <i>Ast</i>, old Danish word signifying (<i>love</i>) and <i>ild</i>
(<i>fire</i>).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>AUKTHOR</b>, a name given to Thor: it means Thor the charioteer,
from <i>âka</i> (to drive), Swedish verb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>AUDUMBLA</b>, name of the mythologic cow formed by the
Fiat of Alfader (the quisquis deorum), at the creation of
the universe. By licking the salt rocks in Ginnungagap,
she occasioned the birth of Bure, the progenitor of the
Asar race. The cow Audumbla represents the organic
power of nature acting upon the Chaos. The word, I
think, means “development,” from the Icelandic words
<i>aud</i>, particle signifying <i>facility</i>, and <i>embla</i> (laborious).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BALDER</b> is the son of Odin and Frigga, the most beloved
of his father and mother, the most benevolent among the
Asar, the sun personified, the god of light, piety and poesy.
He was slain by his twin brother Hædur, born blind, with
a branch of the mistletoe. His fate and its consequences
have been related at length in the preliminary discourse
to this poem. Balder typifies the sun at the summer solstice,
and his death the disappearance of the sun from the
horizon during the winter months in the north, while
Hædur, type of darkness, reigns. The word in Icelandic
means <i>brilliant</i>, <i>beautiful</i>, <i>powerful</i>. Balder has an evident
analogy with the <i>Baal</i> of the Assyrians, the <i>Apollo</i> of the
Greeks, the <i>Horus</i> of the Egyptians, the <i>Krïshna</i> of the
Hindoos, all of which are types of the sun in its highest
splendour.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BAUGE</b>, name of a giant, who procured for Odin entrance
into the bower of Gunliod, when he sought to make himself
master of the vase containing the precious liquor called
<i>Suttung’s mead</i>, which was confided to the care of Gunliod.
<i>Bolverk</i> was the name assumed by Odin on that occasion.
<i>Baug</i> in Icelandic means a “ring,” and among the
northern nations in the Gothic time promises were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
by holding a ring; and this mythe may mean Odin’s seduction
of Gunliod by means of a promise given on the
ring.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BERGELMER</b>, name of the giant who, with his wife, were
the only ones of that race who escaped being drowned in
the blood of Ymer. He and his consort escaped on a
wreck, and landed on the top of a mountain. From these
two descended the second generation of giants. This
mythe reminds one of the deluge of Noah and that of Deucalion
and Pyrrha, and the mountain, mount Ararat; for
<i>Bergelmer</i> means the <i>ancient of the mountain</i>, from <i>berg</i>
(mountain), and <i>gamla</i> (old).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BERSERK</b> (bare sark), name given to a sort of combatants
among the ancient Scandinavians, who affected peculiar
ferocity, and fought with their fists and teeth, in the absence
of other weapons, and in no other clothing but their
shirt; hence their name. <i>Berserkgang</i> is a term used to
signify a combat of life and death, and is often applied to
the exploits of Thor, to denote their peculiar danger and
difficulty.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BETSLA</b>, name of a beautiful giantess, the wife of Bor, and
mother of Odin, Vil and Ve.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BIFROST</b>, name of the vast bridge which unites heaven to
earth, and typifies the <i>rainbow</i>. Over this bridge the Asar
must pass when they descend to the world below; over it
must likewise pass the heroes slain in battle, when they
ascend to Valhalla, escorted by the Valkyrior. Etym.:
from the Icelandic words <i>bifa</i> (to move) and <i>röst</i> (stone).
The bridge Bifrost was supposed to be constructed of
stones of various colours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BILSKIRNIR</b>, name of the palace or castle of Thor, in
Trudvang. It is tiled with copper shields, its halls are inlaid
with gold and silver, and it has five hundred and forty
gates. Etym.: Icelandic words <i>billd</i> (aspect, image), and
<i>skirna</i> (make bright).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BOLVERK</b>, name assumed by Odin when he served Bauge,
disguised as a labourer. The etymology of this word may
be <i>böll</i> (a bolt) and <i>verk</i> (work).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BOR</b>, or Bör, name of the son of Bure; by his union with
the beautiful giantess Betsla, he became the father of the
Scandinavian triad, Odin, Vil, and Ve. Bor, in Icelandic,
means <i>son</i>. But I suspect the word to be of Hebrew origin,
meaning <i>beginning</i>; for <i>böra</i> is precisely the Hebrew
word wherewith the first book of Genesis begins.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BRAGUR</b>, or <b>BRAGA</b>, an Asa, the god of poetry and musical
declamation. At the banquets of Valhalla, he chaunts
to the sound of his harp the praises of the gods and Einherier,
and celebrates in high-flown language their virtues
and warlike deeds. He is the husband of Iduna. He is
called by the poets of the north, <i>Bragur hin gamle</i> (<i>Bragur
the ancient</i>). Etym.: Icelandic verb <i>bragga</i> (to adorn,
to embellish). Our English word <i>to brag</i> comes probably
from the same root.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BREIDABLIK</b>, name of the palace of Balder, in Asagard;
it is tiled with pearls! Etym.: <i>breid</i> (broad, extended),
<i>blik</i> (view).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>BURE</b>, father of Bor, and progenitor of the Asar race:
his production, effectuated by the cow Audumbla, has
been already related in the translator’s preface. <i>Bure</i> in
Icelandic has the same meaning as Bör, i.e. son. Both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
words come probably from the Hebrew or Zend, and
mean the same thing, viz. <i>origin</i> or <i>beginning</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>DAG</b> (day), the son of Delling.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>DELLING</b>, name of the father of Dag (day); the word
means <i>division</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>DISA</b>, pl. <b>DISAR</b>; name given to the Asynior, or goddesses.
This word is evidently of Persian origin.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>DISARSAL</b> (hall of the Disar), name often given to the palace
of Vingolf, the peculiar place of reunion for the goddesses
in Asagard.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>DOVRE</b>, name of a chain of mountains in Norway, which
seems to bear the same relation to Asagard as the natural
mount Olympus in Greece bears to the mythological one.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>DRAPA</b> means <i>funeral dirge</i>, or song of the <i>apotheosis</i>. In it
were celebrated the funeral ceremonies of a deceased hero,
his glorious actions recapitulated, and his elevation to the
rank of an Einherier and admission into Valhalla triumphantly
announced. The English word <i>dirge</i> comes, perhaps,
from the Icelandic and Swedish verb <i>dyrka</i> (to adore).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>DRUPNER</b>, name of a magic ring fabricated for Odin by
the dwarfs, at the command of Asa-Lok. This ring had
the faculty of dropping eight other rings on every ninth
night: by this is typified the change of the moon and its
phases. When Odin placed the ring Drupner on the bosom
of his son Balder, when he laid his corpse upon the
funeral pile, he whispered a secret in his ear. This may
allude to the promise of resurrection, but none knew the
secret, save Odin himself. The placing of the ring Drupner
(the moon) on the bosom of Balder (the sun) may typify
the eclipse of the sun by the moon intervening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
Etym.: from the Icelandic verb <i>driupa</i> (to drop, or
distil).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>DVERG</b>, pl. <b>DVERGAR</b> (Dwarf), mythological beings, of
short stature, who dwelt in caverns and were skilful in
the fabrication of metallic instruments. They are unable
to bear the glare of the sun, and prefer to rove about at
night. From this circumstance, and from their being at
times disposed to mischief, they are considered as related
to the giants; but they are employed both by gods and
giants to make armour and other instruments for them.
They are represented as being of an exceedingly timorous
disposition.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>DWARFS</b>, see <b>DVERG</b>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>EIKTHYRNIR</b>, name of the mythological stag which stands
on the roof of the portal of Valaskialf, and from whose
antlers springs a fountain which furnishes water to all
the rivers of the earth. Etym.: <i>eikt</i> (vigils), <i>hyrnir</i>
(horns).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>EINHERIER</b>, name given to mortal warriors deified for their
valour, and admitted among the Asar; they are constant
guests at the banquets of Valhalla. Their occupations
and amusements are thus described in the prosaic Edda:
“Every day they dress themselves in their armour, go out
on horseback to fight, and cut at one another; thus they
pass their time. But when the hour of repast approaches,
they ride home to the palace, and take their seats at the
banquet.” In the elder or poetic Edda, in the chapter
called the Vaftrudnismal, are the following words concerning
them:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Etym.: <i>einn</i> (one, unique), and <i>heria</i> (to bear arms).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>EIR</b>, name of an Asynia, whose office it is to heal the
wounds of the Einherier, when they are first admitted into
Valhalla, by squeezing into their wounds the juice of
the beet. She is, in fact, the goddess of medicine.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ELDIR</b>, name of Ægir’s purveyor; he is supposed to dwell
under the famous whirlpool of Malstrom, and to break in
pieces with his club every bark that is engulfed therein.
Etym.: <i>eld</i> (fire), and may allude to the subterranean fire
supposed to be under Malstrom, and to cause its effervescence.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ELIVAGOR</b> is, mythologically, the collective name of the
rivers that flow from the source Hvergelmer, in Ginnungagap.
Geographically, Elivagor is thought to mean the
mouth of the White Sea. Etym.: <i>elf</i> (a stream), and <i>vaga</i>
(to wander).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ELYERHOY</b>, name of a hill or barrow in the island of
Sealand (Denmark), so called from its being the supposed
habitation of <i>alfs</i> or <i>elves</i>. In Danish, <i>hoi</i> means <i>height</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>EMBLA</b>, name of the first woman, according to the Scandinavian
mythology. See Askur. <i>Embla</i> means <i>laborious</i>,
<i>productive</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FENRIS</b>, name of the mythologic wolf, begotten by Asa-Lok<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
on the witch or giantess Angurbod. He is malignant,
frightful to behold, and his nostrils vomit fire. His presence
inspired the gods with such terror, that they endeavoured
to bind him with chains of iron and copper;
but these he easily burst asunder; they then had resource
to a stratagem, and succeeded in binding him with a
magic chain, which was composed as follows: of the noise
of cat’s feet, of the beards of women, of the breath of
birds, of the saliva of fish, of the nerves of bears, and of
the roots of mountains. This chain he could not break.
The Asar then cast him down into Niffelheim, and placed
him at the gate of Helheim, the residence of Hela. There
he is to remain chained until Ragnarok; he will then
break his chain, join in the battle of the giants against the
gods, and devour Odin; but he will be afterwards himself
slain by Vidar. By Fenris wolf is typified the subterranean
fire, which it is supposed will one day occasion the
conflagration of the universe. Etym.: <i>Fenia</i> (giantess or
sorceress), <i>risi</i> (to spring from).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FENSAL</b>, name of the palace of Frigga, in Asagard. Probable
etym.: <i>fengisall</i> (happy in acquiring riches).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FIALAR</b>, name of the mythologic cock which is to crow at
Ragnarok, to excite the gods and giants to combat.
<i>Fiallar</i>, in Icelandic, means <i>cock</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FINNAFENG</b>, name of the cook of Ægir, god of the sea;
he is slain by Asa-Lok for refusing him admittance to
Ægir’s banquet. The etymology may be from the Icelandic
words <i>fina</i> (a piece of flesh), <i>fenge</i> (a capture).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FOLKVANGUR</b> or <b>FOLKVANG</b>, name of the palace of
Freya in Asagard, into which are admitted, after death,
faithful lovers and virtuous women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FORSETE</b>, an Asa, the son of Balder, and god of justice;
he dwells in his palace Glitner. He often descends to
earth, to sit in judgment, and hear causes under the shade
of the ash-tree Yggdrassil, near the fountain of Urda.
He is the son of Balder, inasmuch as justice proceeds
from light; and as Urda is the Norna or destiny of the
past, it is from her fountain (i.e. consulting the records
of the past) that he acquires experience. The etymology
of this word is <i>for</i> (before), and <i>sete</i> (set), ergo <i>præses</i>,
<i>president</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FREY</b>, or <b>FREYR</b>, is the god of liberty, joy and fecundity;
he is the son of Niord, and brother of Freya. He is invoked
for sunshine and good crops. He represents the
sun at the winter solstice. The new year’s feast was instituted
to do him honour; it was the day of his birth, and
a season of festivity and joy. He was the owner of a
magic sword, but falling in love with Gerda, a beautiful
damsel of Jotun race, he gave it away to her father, in
order to obtain his consent to their union. He is to be
slain by Surtur at Ragnarok. Etym.: <i>frei</i> (free), <i>friò</i>
(seed). It is remarkable that in Egypt the sun was called
<i>Phré</i>. The Swedish word <i>fröid</i> (joy) is probably derived
from the name of this god.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FREYA</b> is the Venus of the Scandinavians, the goddess of
love, beauty, pleasure and fecundity; she is the sister of
Frey, and daughter of Niord. She is the most beautiful
of all the Asynior. She was married to Odur; but when
the goddess Iduna, with her golden vase containing the
fruit of immortality, was stolen from Asagard, Freya, in
common with the other Asar, lost her youth and beauty;
and Odur, disgusted at the change, fled from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
embraces. On the deliverance of Iduna, Freya recovered
her youth and beauty, but her Odur never returned. She
wandered all over the earth in search of him, but in vain.
She weeps continually for his loss, and sheds tears of
gold. When she travels, it is in a golden car, drawn by
two black cats. Freya has two daughters, Siofna and
Hnos, both remarkable for their beauty and gentleness.
The Dutch word <i>fraai</i> (handsome), is derived probably
from Freya.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FRIGGA</b> is the wife of Odin, the queen of the gods, the
Juno and Ceres of the Scandinavian mythology. She
sometimes typifies the earth, as Odin does the heavens;
they become thus identic with the Ουρανος and Γη of the
Greeks. She is pleased with offerings of fruits and
flowers, and is herself extremely generous and beneficent.
The constellation “Orion’s belt,” is termed by the Scalds
the “spinning-wheel of Frigga.” She is the mother of
Balder, Hædur, Thor, etc. The etymology of Frigga is
<i>friò</i> (seed), <i>gà</i> (to take care of).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>FULLA</b>, name of an Asynia, the handmaid and confidante
of Frigga, and guardian of her jewels and wardrobe. She
hands round the plates to the guests at the banquet of
Valhalla. Her name typifies <i>abundance</i>; <i>voll</i>, <i>full</i>, in the
German and English languages, and <i>fuld</i>, <i>full</i>, in the
Danish and Swedish, all meaning the same thing, are
probably derived therefrom.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GARDERIKE</b>, name given by the ancient Scandinavians to
a part of Russia.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GARM</b>, name of the mythologic dog, who remains chained
at the cavern of Gnypa, until Ragnarok; he will then
break his chain, and fight with Tyr; both will perish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GAUTHIOD</b> (Gothland), a name of Sweden.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GEFION</b>, an Asynia, the goddess of virginity, herself a
virgin; she receives in her domain in Asagard women,
who die unmarried. She is the founder of the island of
Sealand (Denmark), which was supposed to have been
formerly joined to the continent of Sweden, and which,
at her request, was ploughed around, separated from the
mainland, and dragged into the Ocean by the sons of
Gyllfe, who, to please her, transformed themselves into
oxen, and performed the said service.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GEIRSODD</b> means “point of a lance.” The historical
Odin, when on his death-bed, cut his veins with the point
of a lance, assuring his surviving followers and companions,
that those who died on the field of battle, or in
this manner covered with blood, would meet him in Valhalla,
and partake of all the delights of the immortals.
Hence the natural death by old age or sickness, called
emphatically <i>strâ död</i> (death on the straw), was looked
upon as ignominious by the northern warriors, and as
exposing them to the danger of falling into the clutches
of Hela. They, in consequence, when they felt their
end approaching, either by old age or sickness, opened
their veins, and bled to death; this was called <i>cutting
runes to Odin</i>, or otherwise <i>geirsodd rita</i> (to scratch with
the point of a lance); and this, as they believed, ensured
them admission into Valhalla.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GERDA</b>, a beautiful damsel of Jotun race, daughter of the
giant Gymer. She was united to Frey with the consent
of all the gods, and admitted among the Asynior. She
was renowned for her beauty, piety and virtue. Finn
Magnussen thinks that Gerda is a type of the <i>aurora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
borealis</i>, which replaces the light of the sun in winter, in
the extreme northern regions; Frey himself typifying the
sun. Others suppose that Gerda typifies the earth, and
her amour with Frey the relationship between the earth
and the sun.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GESTUR</b>, name of a blind giant who proposes riddles and
enigmas to Skirnir on his journey to the world below,
for the purpose of visiting Gerda.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GIALLAR</b>, name of the horn of Heimdal, which he blows,
to give notice to the gods of those who arrive at, and
attempt to cross the bridge Bifrost. Etym.: Icelandic
verb <i>gala</i> (to sing, to call out). The English verb <i>call</i>,
and the Swedish and Danish verbs <i>kalla</i>, <i>kalde</i>, come
from the same root.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GIANTS</b>, called in the Scandinavian dialects Jotun, Jetter,
Jâttar, the evil genii of the Gothic mythology. At Ragnarok
they are to fight with and defeat the Asar on the
plains of Vigrid; but they are themselves to perish in the
conflagration that ensues, and they will never be resuscitated
(i.e. in a future state of existence there will be no
violence or crime). The giants dwell in their peculiar
territory, Jotunheim, in Utgard, and are ruled by their sovereign,
Lok, commonly called Utgard-Lok, to distinguish
him from an Asa of the same name. The giants were
supposed to be of various forms and races, some having
the heads of wild beasts joined to human bodies, and
others the human form entire. They understood magic,
were capable of assuming divers shapes, and of increasing
or diminishing their stature <i>ad libitum</i>. They seem to
bear a great resemblance to the Titans of the Greek, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
to the Afrites of the Mohammedan theology, and all are
borrowed from the Persian system, the doctrine of the
Magi.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GIMLE</b>, the most beautiful of all buildings, in which virtuous
mortals are to dwell together with the gods, after the
reconstruction of the universe, in eternal joy and felicity.
The grave is often termed by the Scalds, “the verdant
gate of Gimle.” The German word Himmel (heaven) is
derived therefrom. Etym.: from the Icelandic word <i>gimlir</i>
(splendour).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GINNUNGAGAP</b>, name of the vast abyss which existed
before the present world, and separated Niffelheim (region
of fog) from Muspelheim (region of heat). Etym.: <i>Ginning</i>
(between), and <i>gapi</i> (to yawn or open). The following
verbs, in different languages, all come from the Icelandic
verb <i>gapi</i>, and have the very same meaning, viz.
<i>to gape</i>, English; <i>gapa</i>, Swedish; <i>gabe</i>, Danish; <i>gapen</i>,
Dutch; <i>gaffen</i>, German; and the Greek words χαω, χαος
and χασμα (chasm) are likewise from the same root.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GLADHEIM</b>, a general name given to the abodes of the
gods in Asagard, and often used as a synonyme for Valhalla.
Etym.: <i>glad</i> (joy, gladness), and <i>heim</i> (home, or
abode).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GLADHEIMASAL</b> means <i>hall of the abode of gladness</i>, applied
as Gladheim.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GLITNER</b>, name of the palace of Forsete, the god of justice.
The word means <i>equalisation</i>. It represents the station
of the sun between August 23 and September 23,
beginning of the autumnal equinox, corresponding with
the sign of the zodiac Libra (the balance).</p>

When she executes the commissions of her mistress, she
rides on the steed Hofvarpur.</p>

word <i>gnypr</i> (steep).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GUDBRAND</b>, or Guldbrand, name of a fertile valley in the
province of Aggerhuys, in Norway.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GULDVEIGE</b>, a female divinity, personifying riches. Etym.:

<p class="hanging"><b>GUNLIOD</b>, name of the daughter of Suttung, to whose care
her father confided the vase containing the precious beverage
called <i>Suttung’s mead</i>. Seduced by Odin, she surrenders
to him the vase.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GYLLFE</b>, name of a king of Jotun race, who reigned over
a part of Sweden at the time of the invasion of the historical
Odin.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GYLLINBORSTE</b> (golden-bristled), name of the mythological
golden boar, fabricated by the dwarfs at the instance
of Asa-Lok, and presented to Frey to serve him as a steed,
mounted on which he travels round the world. According
to Finn Magnussen, it is a type of the sun.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>GYMER</b>, name of a Jotun or giant, the father of Gerda.
Etym.: <i>gima</i> (<i>transmitting light</i>).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HÆNIR</b>, name of an Asa, the god of intellect; he accompanies
Odin on his travels. By some he is considered as
identic with <i>Vil</i>, the second person of the Scandinavian
mythological triad.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HÆRFADER</b> (father of the fight), one of the many names
given to Odin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HAGBARTH</b>, name of a Norwegian prince, celebrated for
his valour and his attachment to Signe, a Danish princess.
Having had the misfortune to kill Signe’s brother in single
combat, he falls into the hands of the mother, who, to
revenge her son’s death, causes Hagbarth to be hanged.
Signe, in despair at the loss of her lover, destroys herself.
The unfortunate love of Hagbarth and Signe has been the
theme of many a northern ballad, and Œhlenschläger himself
has made it the subject of a most interesting and
pathetic tragedy.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HARBARD</b>, in this poem, is the name of a ferryman of
Jotun race, who refuses to ferry Skirnir across a river
until he has answered his questions and displayed his
knowledge.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HEIDRUNA</b>, name of the mythological goat who stands on
the roof of Valaskialf, and whose teats afford a constant
supply of hydromel to the guests at Valhalla.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HEIMDAL</b>, or Heimdaller, name of an Asa who stands as
sentinel at the bridge of Bifrost, to give notice of the approach
of strangers by blowing his horn Giallar. He is
constantly on the alert to prevent surprise on the part of
the giants. Of him it is said, that he was born of nine
mothers; that he had a tooth of gold; that he could do
without sleep; see at a distance of a hundred miles, as
well by night as by day; hear wool grow on the backs of
sheep, and grasses shoot. By his doing without sleep
may be meant the absence of night from the northern
polar regions during the summer months. At Ragnarok,
he will blow his horn with all his force, to excite the gods
to combat. Etym.: <i>Heim</i> (abode), and <i>dallr</i> (horn).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HEIMKRINGLAS</b>, name given to the universe in the Scandinavian
mythology. Etym.: <i>Heim</i> (abode), <i>kring</i> (round
about), and <i>lâs</i> (clasp).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HELA</b>, or <b>HEL</b>, name of the queen of death and of the
shades below, daughter of Asa-Lok and of the giantess
Angurbod. She is frightful and appalling to behold: her
body is of white or natural colour below the girdle, but
all above is blue or livid, from congealed blood. The gods,
terrified at her sight, exiled her from Asagard, and cast
her down into Niffelheim, to rule over the dead. There,
in her castle Helheim, she receives the ghosts of the
worthless and cowardly, and of those who die of old age
or sickness, who omit to <i>cut runes to Odin</i>. Of Hela it is
said in the prosaic Edda, that her abode is <i>anguish</i>; her
table, <i>famine</i>; her attendants, <i>delay</i> and <i>fruitless expectation</i>;
her threshold, <i>precipice</i>; her bed, <i>lingering sickness</i>;
her bed-curtains, <i>heart-rending care</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HELHEIM</b> (abode of Hela), name of a strong castle situate in
Niffelheim, in the midst of eternal damp, ice, snow and
darkness. Herein Hela receives and detains her dead guests.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HERMOD</b>, an Asa, the messenger of Odin; from his name
and attributes he bears a strong resemblance to the Mercury
of the Greeks, <i>Hermes</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HERTHA</b> (the Earth), a purely allegorical divinity, and
sometimes used as a synonyme for Frigga. In the pagan
time her image was bathed once a year by female slaves,
captives of war, who were afterwards drowned by the
priests in her honour, that they might not reveal to profane
ears the description of the charms and mysteries they had
seen and witnessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HILDUR</b>, name of a heroine in the northern legends, afterwards
deified and enrolled among the Valkyrior. The
story of Hildur, as related by Samsoes, is as follows: Her
lover Hedin and her father Hogni slew one another in
single combat. One night, in the violence of her grief,
she by her magic spells evoked the ghost of Hedin; but
her spells were so powerful, that the ghost of her father
Hogni also arose. The two ghosts commence fighting,
and every night they renew the combat, which is destined
to last until Ragnarok. Hildur is present and applauds
their courage. From this circumstance, War is called by
the Skalds <i>Hildur’s game</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HLESEY</b>, an Island in the Cattegat, supposed to be the peculiar
residence of Ægir, the god of the sea. Hlesey is
now called <i>Lessoe</i>. The word <i>oe</i> in Danish and <i>ö</i> in
Swedish means Island.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HLIDSKIALF</b>, name of an immense high tower in Odin’s
palace Valaskialf, from the top of which he can see all
that passes in the world below.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HLORRIDA</b>, a name given to Thor, when he drives his
car through the air, causing thunder. Etym.: <i>Hliod</i> (sound),
and <i>rida</i> (to ride).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HLYN</b>, name of an Asynia, sent by Frigga to warn mankind
of sudden danger during darkness; from its etymology it
evidently typifies the flash of lightning that occurs at intervals
during a very dark night. The Danish word <i>lyn</i>
signifies “lightning.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HNOS</b>, name of a beautiful female child, the daughter of
Freya. Etym.: <i>hnoss</i>, an Icelandic word meaning <i>a precious
thing</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HOEDUR</b> or <b>HOEDER</b>, an Asa, twin brother of Balder; he
was born blind. How he slew his brother Balder with a
lance made of a branch of mistletoe has been already related.
Hôdur is the type of night and darkness, as Balder
is that of light and day.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HOFVARPUR</b>, name of the steed mounted by Gna the messenger
of Frigga.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HRIMFAX</b>, name of the steed which draws the chariot of
Night. It means “frost bringer;” this steed is sometimes
mounted by Skada.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HRIMTHUSSER</b>, mythologically, the name of a race of
giants; the word means “frost-demon”; and from the
word <i>thuss</i>, demon or evil spirit, comes probably the English
word <i>deuce</i>. Historically, they were probably the name
of some Tartar tribe at war with the Asar, and who harassed
them exceedingly on their march. From being
good archers, and shutting one eye when they took aim,
they obtained the reputation of being one-eyed.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HRINGHORN</b>, name of the bark or vessel of Balder, on
board of which his body was placed, and burnt after his
death. It derives its name from the circumstance of its
prow being decorated with rings of horn. Among the
Skalds a ship was often compared to an animal, and its
masts to the horns of an animal. These masts were made
fast with iron rings round their circumference, and this
I take to be the surest origin of the etymology of the name
Hringhorn or Ringhorn.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HROSVELGER</b>, name of a giant, who, in the shape of an
eagle, causes tempests by the flapping of his wings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
Etym.: <i>hrosi</i> (corpse), and <i>svelge</i> (swallow), the wind
being the cleanser of all impurities.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HRUGNER</b>, name of a giant made of stone, and animated
by the giants, in order to aid them in the conflict with the
Asar. Within his breast, instead of a heart, he had a
three-corner stone. He typifies probably a volcano,
since in the Icelandic tongue <i>Hrungnir</i> signifies “something
that makes a violent noise.” Hrugner was slain
by Thor.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HUGIN</b> and <b>MUNIN</b>, names given to Odin’s two ravens, who
descend to earth, and bring back to him the news from
the nether world; when not employed as messengers,
they perch themselves on Odin’s shoulders. By <i>Hugin</i> is
meant “thought,” and by <i>Munin</i> “memory.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HVERGELMER</b>, name of a source or fountain in Niffelheim.
Etym.: <i>Hver</i> (urn or kettle), and <i>gamla</i> (old).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>HYMIR</b>, name of a giant, with whom Thor goes a-fishing
in the disguise of a peasant lad. He catches the serpent
Jormundgard, but Hymir files in two the anchor which
served as a hook, and the serpent escapes.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>IDA</b>, <b>IDAVALLEN</b>, name of the plain, on which the
resuscitated Asar and the human race are to be assembled
by Vidar, after the reconstruction of the world.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>IDUNA</b>, name of an Asynia, wife of Bragur. She is the
guardian of the golden vase, containing the apples of immortality,
the juice of which gives to the gods perpetual
youth, health and beauty. She was once carried off from
Asagard by the giant Thiasse, aided by the treachery of
Asa Lok; and the gods became at once old and feeble;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span>
but when Iduna was recovered, and brought back to
Valhalla with her precious vase, the gods recovered all
their power and advantageous attributes. This mythe of
Iduna’s apples has its parallel in the Amreeta (drink of
immortality) in the Hindoo mythology.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ISSEFIORD</b>, name of a large creek or <i>fiord</i>, in the island
of Sealand (Denmark), lying towards the north.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>JETTE</b>, pl. <b>JETTER</b>, <b>JOTUN</b>. So were called the evil
genii or giants of the Gothic mythology. Historically,
they were probably the aboriginal inhabitants of Scandinavia,
and were of Celtic race, with black hair. Being
engaged in continual and deadly warfare with the Asar
or Goths, from the time of Odin’s invasion, these last
may have, from a spirit of national hatred, transferred
the appellation Jotun to the evil genii of their own mythology,
before that epoch termed <i>Hrimthusser</i>. In spite,
however, of the hatred and jealousy between the Asar
and Jetter, they sometimes, like the Spaniards and Moors,
formed political and also matrimonial alliances.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>JORMUNGARD</b>, name of the mythologic serpent, called
also the serpent of Midgard. This serpent was offspring
of Asa Lok, by the giantess Angurbod. His enormous
size and frightful appearance excited such terror in the
breast of the gods, that they hurled him down into the
ocean that surrounds Midgard. There he is to remain
until Ragnarok. On that day he will join the giants in
the battle against the gods, and will be slain by Thor;
but Thor will perish himself immediately after, from the
effect of the serpent’s venom. This serpent is represented
by the poets as holding his tail in his mouth, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>
no doubt an emblem of the great Ocean, which was
thought in those times to encircle the earth. His venom
represents the dangerous effects of humidity. In the
Hindoo mythology, there is the serpent <i>Naga</i>, which
typifies the Ocean. Etym.: <i>jord</i> (earth), <i>munr</i> (mouth),
<i>gard</i> (inclosure).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>JOTUN</b> (giant); see <i>Jette</i> and <i>Giant</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>JOTUNHEIM</b>, peculiar province of the Jotun or giants in
Utgard. Geographically, it is thought to denote Siberia.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>LAUFEY</b>, or <b>LAUFEIA</b>, name of a giantess, the mother of
Asa Lok.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>LEIRE</b>, name of the ancient capital of Denmark, situated on
the Issefiord, in Sealand. Leire was the theatre of many
an important event. The modern city of Roskild is very
near the spot, where Leire once stood.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>LIF</b> and <b>LIFTRASIR</b>, names of two mythological beings,
who remain concealed in the wood of Hoddmimer, at the
destruction of the world, and from whom the new race of
men are to spring; these beings are purely allegorical,
for <i>lif</i> signifies “life,” and <i>liftrasir</i> “producer of life.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>LINDERNÆS</b>, name of a promontory on the southern coast
of Norway, in the canton of Mandal.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>LODER</b>, an Asa, who conferred beauty on mankind; by
some he is confounded with Ve, the third person of the
Scandinavian mythologic triad.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>LOFNA</b>, name of an Asynia, who presided over marriage.
Etym.: Icelandic verb <i>lofa</i> (to promise, to betroth).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>LOK</b>, <b>ASA LOK</b>, <b>UTGARD LOK</b>. In the Gothic mythology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span>
there are two important personages of the name of
Lok or Loke, in the earliest times perhaps identic, but in
the latter divided; namely Lok of Utgard, the supreme
ruler of the giants or malevolent spirits, belonging to our
world’s system, who dwells in and rules over Utgard; and
Asa Lok, originally of giant race, but admitted among the
Asar. According to Ling, a modern Swedish poet, in the
notes to his poem, called <i>Asarne</i> (the Asar), the mythe of
the two Loks is thus explained: Utgard Lok represents
the subterranean fire and its destructive effects, earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions; Asa Lok represents the
deleterious qualities of the air, such as tempests and unwholesome
exhalations. In my opinion, the most simple
explanation of this mythe would be as follows: Utgard
Lok typifies physical evils and calamities, and in this respect
he resembles the Siva of the Hindoos; as possessor of subterranean
riches, he resembles the Plutus of the Greeks,
who, as we are told, was related to Pluto. Asa Lok is
the type of moral evil, or the propensity to vice in human
nature, which has been personified by the Orientals, under
the various names of Satan, Ahrimanes, Belial and Eblis.
The punishment inflicted on Asa Lok for his treachery
has been already related. At Ragnarok, he will break his
chain, and join in combat with the giants against the gods.
He and Heimdal will destroy each other.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>LOPTUR</b>, a name given to Asa Lok; it means <i>one who
runs through the air</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>MALSTROM</b>, name of the famous whirlpool on the coast of
Norway, near Lofoden. <i>Malstrom</i> signifies “millstream.”
It is called by the Skalds the <i>mill of Ægir</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>MAANEGARM</b>, name of the mythologic winged goblin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span>
who constantly pursues the moon (maane), and will
swallow her up at Ragnarok.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>MANHEIM</b> (abode of man), a name often given to Midgard,
or the earth.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>MEGINGARD</b> (girdle of strength), name of Thor’s belt,
which had the faculty of doubling his force when he
girded himself with it.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>MIDGARD</b>, name given to the earth, as being in the <i>middle
region</i> between Asagard and Utgard.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>MIMER</b>, an Asa, the god of eloquence and of wisdom; he
sits by the wave of Urda, called the fountain of wisdom,
of which he is the guardian, and which springs near the
ash-tree Yggdrassil. Urda is the destiny of the past, so
that the allegory is clear; by consulting the records of the
past, we gain wisdom and experience.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>MIÖLNER</b> (breaker in pieces), name of Thor’s hammer,
type of the thunderbolt.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>MOKKURKALF</b>, name of a gigantic figure made of clay,
and animated by the giants, that he might aid them against
Thor. They gave to him the heart of a horse. This may
allude to the custom among many heathen nations of consecrating
an idol of clay, wood or stone, by putting therein
the heart of a man, or of some animal. Mokkurkalf was
slain by Tialf.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>MUSPEL</b>, <b>MUSPELHEIM</b>, name given to the region of
fire and heat which lies to the south of Ginnungagap, and
from whence at Ragnarok, Surtur will collect flames,
and set fire to the universe. Flames are often termed by
the Scalds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span> “the children of Muspel.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NAGLEFARE</b> (ship of nails), name of a bark or vessel
built by the giants. As its name imports, it was built of
men’s nails. On board of this vessel, the giants will embark
at Ragnarok, to give battle to the gods. The giants
are continually at work to increase its size; hence, those
who neglect to cut off the nails from the hands and feet of
dead men, contribute to the building of this vessel, and to
the mischief that will ensue from it. The popular belief
of the continuation of the growth of the hair and nails
after death, has probably contributed to this mythe.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NANNA</b>, an Asynia, the wife of Balder, renowned for her
piety and constancy. At his death she threw herself on his
funeral pile, and was burned with him.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NARF</b>, name of a giant, the father of Night, and also the
name of one of Asa-Lok’s sons by Sigyn.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NASTROND</b>, name of a frightful and noisome marsh in
the subterranean world, filled with venomous serpents,
and destined as a place of punishment in the future life for
those who are absolutely incorrigible.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NIDAROS</b>, a city in Norway of great historical celebrity, the
ancient capital of the kingdom, and now called Trondhjem,
and by the Germans Drontheim.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NIDDING</b> means “<i>scoundrel</i>,” “<i>worthless fellow</i>;” it was
the greatest insult to a Scandinavian to call him a Nidding,
and the offence could only be expiated by the blood of the
offender.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NIDHÖG</b>, name of a frightful dragon that dwells in the
marsh of Nastrond, and who continually gnaws the root
of the Ash-tree Yggdrassil. Etym.: <i>nid</i> (reproach, abuse),
<i>högg</i> (blow), in Icel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NIFFELHEIM</b>, department of Utgard, region of eternal
cold, fog, darkness and horror, lying to the north of Ginnungagap.
It is sometimes used as a synonyme for Utgard,
or for Helheim. <i>Niffel</i> means “fog.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NIORD</b>, or <b>NIORDUR</b>, is the Æolus of the Scandinavians,
the god of the winds. He is of Vaner race, and is father
of Frey and Freya. He was admitted among the Asar to
preside over the winds and is the type of the north wind in
particular. He is invoked by fishermen and travellers.
He was afterwards married to Skada, daughter of the
giant Thiasse.&mdash;Niord is of a very friendly and benevolent
disposition. See the articles <i>Skada</i> and <i>Vaner</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>NORNA</b>, pl. <b>NORNOR</b>, name of the Parcæ, or Fates of
the Scandinavians; they were three in number, viz. Urda,
Norna, or destiny of the past; Verdandis, of the present;
Skulda, of the future. They sit near the Ash Yggdrassil,
the tree of time, where they weave the woof of human
destiny.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ODIN</b> is the Chief Asa, the king of gods and men, the Jupiter
and Mars of the Scandinavian mythology, and the
grand progenitor of the Scandinavian kings. Some think
that this was the name given to the supreme God of nature
by the Asar, previous to the invasion of the north-west
of Europe by the historical Odin, whose real name is said
to be Sigge (conqueror); and that the name of Odin was
assumed by Sigge during his life, or given to him by his
followers after his death. Others think that the real name
of the great conqueror was Odin, and that his name was
given to the supreme unknown God. At all events, the
historical Odin was deified after his death, and being confounded
with the mythologic one, was from that period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span>
worshipped as the supreme ruler of the universe. Odin
has an immense number of appellations, the most remarkable
of which are Alfader, Hœrfader and Valfader.
As god of war he is accompanied by two favourite wolves,
one called Gere (rapacity), and the other Freke (audacity),
to whom he gives his share of food at the banquet of Valhalla;
for according to the Edda, Odin lives on wine alone.
Odin has also two favourite ravens, one called Hugin
(thought), the other Munin (memory), who sit perched on
his shoulders, and whom he sometimes dispatches to bring
him news from the nether world. At Ragnarok, Odin is
to be swallowed up by the wolf Fenris. Odin bears a
lance called Gugner.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ODUR</b>, name of the husband of Freya, whom he abandoned
on the loss of her youth and beauty. He was
changed into a statue by Odin, as a punishment for his
desertion. He was the inventor of the art of making
wine.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>OLUF</b>, a king of Denmark, slain by Starkodder, whom he
afterwards meets in Valhalla.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>QVASER</b>, name of a chief of Vaner race by his mother;
his father, name unknown, was an Asa. He taught mankind
arts and sciences, but particularly poetry. He was
killed by two dwarfs, who mixed his blood with honey,
and poured it into a golden vase. This drink had the faculty
of inspiring poetical talent. Suttung, the brother
of Qvaser, revenged his death on the two dwarfs, by binding
them to a rock in the mid-ocean, where they suffer
perpetual hunger. He then took the vessel containing the
sacred liquor, and gave it in charge to his daughter Gunliod.
This liquor is called by the Scalds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span> “Suttung’s mead,”
and is used as a synonyme for poetical inspiration. Etym.:
<i>Qvasir</i>, Icelandic word meaning “breath” or “inspiration.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>RAGNAROK</b>, called also “the twilight of the gods,” is the
<i>last day</i>, according to the Scandinavian mythology, the
day, on which the whole creation, gods, giants, and mankind
are to perish in a shower of fire and blood. Ragnarok
will be preceded by a dreadfully severe winter of three
years duration, called the Fimbul-vetr. At Ragnarok the
wolf Fenris will break his chain, and so will Lok. A grand
battle will be fought between the gods and giants on the
plains of Vigrid, wherein the latter will be victorious; but
it will be a fruitless victory, for Surtur, with flames from
Muspelheim, will set fire to the universe, and involve
victors and vanquished in general destruction. Vidar alone
will survive the general conflagration and reconstruct the
universe. The etymology of the word Ragnarok, I conceive
to be the two Icelandic words: <i>ragna</i> (to imprecate,
implore vengeance), and <i>rok</i> (violent tempest). Some
derive it from <i>regin</i> (dynasts or gods), and <i>röckur</i> (twilight).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>RAN</b> or <b>RANA</b>, name of a giantess, wife of Ægir the god of
the sea. She is of an extremely malevolent disposition,
and takes pleasure in causing shipwrecks and drowning
sailors. In the pagan time, when seamen found their
ship about to sink, it was their custom to hold a piece of
money in their hand, to propitiate Ran. In fact, Ran personifies
the dangers and destructive properties of the sea;
Ægir the salubrious and beneficial ones. The word <i>Ran</i>
in Icelandic means “rapacity,” and from it comes the
Danish verb <i>rane</i> (to rob).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>RATATOSK</b>, name of the mythologic squirrel that resides
on the branches of the Ash Yggdrassil, and employs himself
in running up and down the tree, in order to sow discord
between the Eagle Hrosvelger, who sits on the top,
and the dragon Nidhög, who lies at its root. This will remind
the reader of the fable of Æsop of the eagle, the cat
and the sow.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>RINDA</b>, name of a princess of Garderike, seduced by Odin.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ROSKA</b>, name of a peasant’s daughter who, with her brother
Tialfe, was adopted by Thor and accompanied him on his
travels. She was elevated to the rank of an Asynia, and
placed in Folkvang, to dwell with Freya.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>RUNES</b>, mean “letters of the alphabet” or writings.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SAGA</b>, an Asynia, the goddess of history; she is represented
with a graver and shield, on which she engraves events
worthy of commemoration.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SÆHRIMNER</b>, name of the mythologic hog, whose flesh furnishes
food for the banquets of Valhalla. It is killed every
morning and resuscitated every night.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SIF</b>, or <b>SIFIA</b>, an Asynia, the wife of Thor, renowned for
the beauty of her hair. Asa-Lok, to revenge himself
on Sif for spurning his addresses, cut off her hair while
she was asleep; but he was compelled by Thor to procure
for her a new head of hair, made of gold by the dwarfs.
Hence gold is often termed by the Scalds <i>Sifs hair</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SIGNE</b>, name of a Danish princess.&mdash;See Hagbarth.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SIGYN</b>, the wife of Asa-Lok; she alone does not abandon him in
his adversity; and when he is chained in the subterranean
cavern, with the enormous serpents hanging over him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[lx]</a></span>
she holds out a vase to catch the venom they let drop.
When the vase is filled, she goes out to empty it; the venom
of the serpents then falling on Lok, causes him to
writhe with pain, and this movement causes earthquakes.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SIOFNA</b>, an Asynia, daughter of Freya; she presides over
sleep and sends pleasing dreams. Etym.: Icelandic verb
<i>sofna</i> (to sleep).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SKADA</b>, daughter of the giant Thiasse; she comes to
Valhalla in a fury, to revenge her father’s death, becomes
pacified at the sight of Balder, and having caught Niord
at a game of blindman’s-buff, obtains him for a husband;
but their tempers being very different, she being capricious
and violent, and he placid and benevolent, they soon quarrel.
They cannot agree about their place of residence;
she wishing to dwell in the mountains inland, and he preferring
to dwell on the sea-shore. Niord says:</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SKALDS</b>, or <b>SCALDS</b>; so the poets were called in Scandinavia.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SKIDBLADNER</b> or <b>SKYBLADNER</b>, name of a ship given
to the gods by Gerda, on her marriage with Frey. When not
required for navigation, it could be folded up like a scarf.
It seems to resemble the Sverga, or ship of heaven, of the
Hindoos; and they are both probably types of the clouds,
for <i>sky</i> is “cloud,” and <i>blad</i> a leaf, in the Icelandic tongue.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SKINFAX</b>, name of the steed who draws the chariot of day.
Its meaning is “light-bearer,” the φωσφορος of the Greeks.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SKIRNIR</b>, name of an Asa, messenger of Frey; he is sent

<p class="hanging"><b>SKRYMER</b>, name of a giant who meets Thor on his
journey to Utgard and leads him astray. He mystifies him

<p class="hanging"><b>SNOTRA</b>, an Asynia extremely graceful, who inspires mankind
with elegance of gesture and diction. Etym.: Icelandic
verb <i>snotra</i> (to teach manners).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>STARKODDER</b>, name of a celebrated Scandinavian warrior.
He slew king Oluf in a perfidious manner, but having
afterwards greatly distinguished himself by a series of
brilliant actions, he seems to have obliterated his crime,
for he was deified after his death. He may be considered
in some measure as the Hercules of the Goths.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>SURTUR</b>, name of a formidable giant, who, with flames
collected from Muspelheim, is to set fire to the universe

<p class="hanging"><b>THIASSE</b>, name of a giant, father of Skada. In the shape
of an eagle he carries off Asa-Lok, and compels him to

griffin, but is burnt to death by falling into the bale fire at
Breidablik.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>THOR</b>, an Asa, son of Odin and Frigga, the god of war,
strength, and thunder. He plays a most prominent part
in the Gothic mythology. He is the arch enemy of the
giants, and is constantly employed in punishing crime and
oppression and protecting the weak and virtuous. His
various actions are described in this poem, of which he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>
the principal hero. He is the owner of a famous hammer
called <i>Miölner</i>, and of a no less famous belt called <i>Megingard</i>;
he wears steel gauntlets and brazen armour. He
travels usually in a golden car, drawn by two white goats,
<i>Tanngniostr</i> and <i>Tanngrisner</i>; when that car rolls along
the heavens, it causes thunder and lightning. The worship
of Thor seems to be of very remote antiquity; he typifies
probably the occult force of nature, which checks the
blind fury of the elements and brings them back to their
proper limits. There is no mention of Thor as an historical
personage. Odin is thought to have introduced
the worship of Thor into Scandinavia; hence, by mythologic
filiation, he is said to be Thor’s father; or this relationship
may typify <i>supreme force</i> proceeding from <i>supreme
wisdom</i>. Thor defeats and puts to flight the giants;
thus does thunder disperse noxious exhalations and purify
the atmosphere. Thor seems to resemble the Indra of
the Hindoo mythology.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>THRYMUR</b>, name of a giant who falls in love with Freya.
Having obtained possession of Thor’s hammer, Miölner,
he offers to restore it on condition of obtaining the hand
of Freya. The gods are unwilling to part with Freya, but
hit on the expedient of sending Thor disguised as Freya,
and Asa-Lok as female attendant, down to Thrymur’s
abode in Jotunheim. As soon as Thor obtains his hammer,
he throws off his female attire, and slays Thrymur
and all his followers.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>TIALFE</b>, or Tialf, name of a young peasant adopted by
Thor and admitted among the Asar; he accompanies
Thor as his shield-bearer in all his expeditions. He is
brother of Roska.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>TING</b>, or <b>THING</b>; a council is so called in the Scandinavian
peninsula. This word has the exact meaning of the
English word “thing,” “business,” etc., and of the
Latin “negotium.” <i>Storting</i> means “grand council,”
for <i>stor</i> signifies “great” in all the Scandinavian dialects.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>TRUDVANG</b>, or <b>TRUDVANGUR</b>, name of the domain of
Thor, in Asagard.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>TROLD</b>, in Swedish <i>Troll</i>, means an evil demon or goblin
in the Scandinavian mythology; they were very fantastic
and grotesque in their appearance. The French word
<i>drôle</i> (anglicè <i>droll</i>) is probably derived therefrom, and
was introduced by the Norsemen when they conquered
Neustria.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>TROLDKÆMPELAND</b>; the giants’ territory was often so
called. Etym.: <i>trold</i> (goblin), <i>kæmpe</i> (warrior), <i>land</i>
(land).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>TYR</b>, an Asa, renowned for his valour, and younger brother
to Thor. His celebrated adventure with the wolf
Fenris, who bites off his hand, is related in the 26th
canto of this poem. Etym.: <i>tyr</i> (brilliant renown).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>ULLER</b>, name of an Asa who presides over archery and
duels.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>URDA</b>, name of the Norna or destiny of the past. Etym.:
Icelandic word <i>urdu</i> (was).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>UTGARD</b> is the name of the territory of the giants. It was
supposed to be to the north of Midgard, and that mountains
of ice formed the barrier between the two regions.
It also signifies the world below, and includes Jotunheim,
Svartalfheim, Niffelheim, and Nastrond. Etym.: <i>ut</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span>
signifies <i>exclusion</i>, anglicè <i>out</i>, and the etymology of <i>gard</i>
has been already given as meaning <i>enclosure</i>. Utgard-Lok
is the ruler of Utgard.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>UTGARD-LOK</b>, see <b>LOK</b>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VAFTRUDNER</b>, name of a giant celebrated for his wisdom,
who is consulted by Odin under the name of Gangrôd
(weary wanderer.) Vaftrudner does not, it is true, figure
in this poem, but I introduce him into my catalogue because
I am obliged to quote some passages in a chapter of
the Edda bearing his name, in order to elucidate a passage
of Œhlenschläger. Etym.: <i>vafi</i> (eminent), <i>drutna</i>
(to be proud).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VALA</b>, name of the sibyl or prophetess of the Gothic mythology,
who foretells the destruction of the world.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VALASKIALF</b>, name of the palace of Odin, in Asagard, in
which he holds his court.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VALFADER</b> (father of the choice), name given to Odin
when he presides at the banquets in Valhalla.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VALHALLA</b> (hall of the choice), name of the celebrated
banqueting hall of Odin, in Valaskialf, and theatre of the
convivial festivities of the gods and Einherier.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VALKYRIE</b>, pl. Valkyrior, name of the celestial virgins
who attend the fields of battle in order to carry off to Valhalla
the souls of the heroes who fall. They are mounted
on white horses, with fiery manes and tails. At the banquets
of Valhalla they hand round to the guests the mead
and ale. The word Valkyrie means <i>chooser of the slain</i>,
because they choose from the heaps of slain those who
have shown most courage. Owing to this belief, the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[lxvi]</a></span>
<i>val</i>, which originally meant “choice,” was applied to a
field of battle; hence the Danish word <i>valplads</i> and the
German <i>wahlplatz</i>, both signifying “field of battle.”
<i>Kyrie</i> comes from the old Teutonic verb <i>küren</i> (to
choose); there is therefore, properly speaking, tautology
in the word Valkyrie, both the words of which it is composed
signifying <i>choice</i>. By the Valkyrior are thought to
be typified those meteoric appearances in the heavens,
which were supposed to forebode wars and tumults.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VANER</b>, <b>VANAHEIM</b>; mythologically the Vaner were
elementary divinities, and Vanaheim was supposed to be
situated in the heavens, above the earth, immediately
above Midgard. Geographically, Vanaheim, according
to Snorro Sturleson, was a country lying immediately eastward
of the Tanais or Don river; but the historical Vaner
are represented as a highly civilized people, from whom
the Asar learnt the arts and sciences and all that embellishes
life. Now I am yet to learn that the inhabitants of
the banks of the Don were ever remarkable for refined
culture; I therefore reject the hypothesis of Snorro Sturleson,
and adopt that of Finn Magnussen, who thinks that
by the historical Vaner are meant the Asiatic Greeks or
the Persians, from whom the Asar or Goths might well
learn the arts of civilization. Niord was a chief of Vaner
race; Niord became father of Frey and Freya by his sister.
Such a matrimonial connection was perfectly lawful
among the ancient Persians, and is so among their descendants,
the Parsis or Guebres, to this day. A learned
friend of mine, a Portuguese by birth, by name Dr. Constancio,
much given to the study of philology and the
Eastern languages, thinks that by the Vaner and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[lxvii]</a></span>
country inhabited by them, Vanaheim, may be meant the
country bordering on the lake Van or Erivan, in Armenia;
and this seems extremely probable, as the Armenians
were a Persian peuplade, highly civilized, and professing
in days of old the same religion as the Guebres. Mythologically,
Niord and his son and daughter may have been
divinities worshipped in Armenia, Persia, and Asiatic
Greece, and the Asar may have adopted and incorporated
that worship into their own mythology, just as the Romans
and Greeks adopted many of the divinities and religious
ceremonies of the Egyptians. I think I can perceive a
strong resemblance between Frey and Horus, between
Freya and Astarte, and between Niord and Nereus.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VANDHOSE</b> (water-spout), brother of Skada. Etym.: <i>vand</i>
(water) and <i>hose</i> (trowser) in Danish.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VAR</b>, an Asynia, the goddess of truth; she registers the
vows of mankind and punishes perjury.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VARDOE</b>, an island of East Finnmark on the north-eastern
extremity of Norway, in latitude 75° north.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VAULUNDER</b> is the Vulcan of the Gothic mythology. Historically
he was a smith, celebrated for the beauty and
excellence of his workmanship in metals. He forges weapons
and armour for the gods.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VE</b>, name of the third person in the triad of the Scandinavian
mythology, and son of Bor.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VERDANDIS</b>, or Verandis, name of the Norna or destiny of
the present. Etym.: <i>verandi</i>, participle present of the
Icelandic verb <i>vera</i> (to be).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VIDAR</b>, an Asa, god of wisdom and of silence; he wears
thick shoes, hence he is often called by the Scalds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[lxviii]</a></span> “the
god with the thick shoes.” He never breaks silence, but
his look is so penetrating that he discovers the most secret
thoughts of men. He is to play a most important part at
Ragnarok, and will slay the wolf Fenris. Vidar alone
will survive the general conflagration and reconstruct the
universe on an imperishable basis. Etym.: Icelandic
word <i>vitra</i> (wisdom).</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VIL</b>, one of the sons of Bor, and second person of the
Scandinavian triad, Odin, Vil, and Ve. Of this triad
Sneedorf Birch thinks that <i>Odin</i> typifies air or breath;
<i>Vil</i>, light; and <i>Ve</i>, warmth. The death of Ymer, therefore,
by Odin, Vil, and Ve, typifies the annihilation of ice
and snow, and elicitation of the products of the earth by
air, light, and warmth.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>VINGOLF</b>, name of a palace in Asgard, considered as the
peculiar place of rendezvous of the Asynior or goddesses.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>YGGDRASSIL</b>, name of the mythologic Ash-tree, called
“The tree of the world.” Of this tree it is thus written in
the prosaic Edda: “This ash is the first and greatest of all
trees, which spreads its branches over the whole earth.
It springs from three roots. Near one of these roots, which
pushes the trunk and branches towards Asagard, flows
the fountain of Urda, which contains the water of wisdom,
and of which Mimer is the guardian. The gods often descend
to this spot, to sit in judgment on the actions of
mankind and of one another. They interrogate Urda.
The second root of Yggdrassil stretches towards the region
of the Hrimthusser frost-giants of Utgard. The third root
extends below, as far as Niffelheim, and is continually
gnawed by the dragon Nidhög.” By this, according to
Finn Magnussen, is meant the gradual deterioration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[lxix]</a></span>
world, which will end in its destruction; for the Ash
Yggdrassil is no other than the symbol of our world. May
I be permitted to add my conjecture towards the interpretation
of this mythe: By the first root, which pushes stem
and branches towards Asagard, may be meant the elevation
of our thoughts towards heaven. By the second root,
extending towards the region of the ferocious Hrimthusser,
may be meant the tendency of our minds to fraud, rapine
and violence; and by the third root, gnawed by Nidhög, the
writhings of conscience and of envy: the etymology of the
word Nidhög seems at least to give some weight to my conjecture.</p>

<p class="noindent">Of this tree it is further written in the prosaic Edda:
“On the branches of this Ash dwells an Eagle: he knoweth
much, and between his eyes sits a Hawk, called Väderfalner.
A squirrel, called Ratatosk, runs up and down
the trunk of the Ash-tree, and endeavours to excite discord
between the Eagle and the Dragon Nidhög, who
dwells at its root. Four stags spring round the Ash-tree,
and bite its branches: their names are Dainn, Dvalen,
Dunneyr, and Durathror.” Among the various interpretations
given of this mythe, the following, given by
Grundtvig, seems to me the most happy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[lxx]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">“Yggdrassil is the genealogical tree of the human race; its
triple root denotes the three sorts of men who are to be
found on earth, viz. Those who cooperate powerfully
for a noble and eternal object (children of the gods);
Those who work powerfully, but for an ignoble and temporal
object (children of giants); and lastly, the idle, useless
and powerless, relations of Hela. The Eagle denotes
the human mind in its greatest elevation; the Squirrel
denotes the tempter or type of temptation, who is in
compact with the Dragon. The Hawk denotes the spirit
of divination or presentiment of the future, which agitates
the human brain; and the four Stags denote the
four passions or desires of power, of honour, of wealth,
and of sensual pleasure.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>YMER</b>, name of the giant, the great progenitor of the giant
race. He was slain by Bor and his sons, as has been already
related; and from his body the world was constructed, according
to the following lines in the poetic Edda in the
chapter called Vaftrudnismal:</p>

<p class="noindent">Ymer is evidently the type of the chaos.</p>

<p class="noindent">As the reader may be curious to know how Ymer propagated
his race, I quote the following question and answer
from the Vaftrudnismal. Odin in disguise interrogates, and
Vaftrudner answers:</p>

<h3><i>Additional remarks respecting Valhalla.&mdash;The origin
of its conception and meaning.</i></h3>

<p>Finn Magnussen says in his notes to the Vaftrudnismal,
speaking of the Einherier and their amusements: “This
account of the amusements of the heroes in Valhalla seems,
with respect to the ideas of our forefathers about the
games suited to warriors, to correspond perfectly with
Xenophon’s relation of the warlike diversions of the
Thracians, at a great banquet in his time. These are his
words: ‘A large round table was prepared; the guests
sat round it on benches strewed with leaves, and drank
out of large drinking-horns. After they had drank in
honour of the gods, and sung to them hymns of praise, the
most distinguished Thracians rose up, and began to dance
and put on their armour, leaped up and down, and fought
with naked swords. One cut at another, who immediately
fell in such a manner, that we all thought he was slain;
but it was merely a feigned death in a mimicked fight.
Then the Paphlagonians gave a great shout. The conquerors
stripped the conquered of their armour, and
chaunted a hymn in honour of Sitalka; but the other Thracians
bore out the fallen, and stretched them out, as if they
were dead, although no mischief had happened.’”</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Xenophon’s Anabasis</i>, book <span class="smcapuc">VI</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[lxxii]</a></span></p>

<p>“After that, other warlike spectacles and dances took
place, in which women, who were real Amazons, took
part. As such games were the delight of the Thracians
on the borders of the Black Sea, who were either closely
related to the Goths or the same people, so were they also
among the customs of our forefathers; at least their ideas
of the glories and delights of Valhalla seem to confirm it.”</p>

<h3><i>Opinion of the Swedish poet Ling respecting Valhalla.</i></h3>

<p>Valhalla is the type of <i>heroic renown</i>. In all ages and
among all people, cowards have been held in abhorrence;
for without courage, strength of soul and firm will, nothing
noble can be effectuated. He who exposes his own life to
save another’s, he who year after year endures captivity with
fortitude in order to enforce the truth of his principles, or
meets death with courage, in order to save another from
that fate, acquires now as formerly our admiration and
esteem. He was called by our forefathers Valhalla’s guest;
and on that account Ragnar Lodbrook and Gunnar entertained
the hope, while expiring under the fangs of serpents,
to be received in Valhalla, because they bore their sufferings
with resignation, equally with those heroes who had fallen
in battle. But at Ragnarok Valhalla itself will disappear;
i.e. <i>heroic renown</i> appertains merely to this earthly life, and
with it must finally pass away. Goodness alone lives eternally
on the peaceable ever-green island which rises from
the sea, and on which stands the palace of Gimle.</p>

<p>I here annex a translation I made of a chorus in the tragedy
of Sigurd Ring, by the Swedish poet Stagnelius, as it
gives a lively picture of the Valkyrior and of their occupations
on the field of battle and in Valhalla.</p>

<p>With respect to the proper names, it may be asked why
there is sometimes a variation in the manner of spelling
them; why, for instance, Frey should sometimes be called
Freyr; Niord, Niordur; Heimdal, Heimdaller; Jormundgard,
Jormundgardur. The explanation thereof must be traced
to the Icelandic language itself. In one of the declensions
many of the masculine nouns, and almost all the proper
names masculine, take <i>er</i>, <i>ur</i> and <i>r</i> as terminations of the
nominative case which are omitted in the other cases; and
the Danish, Swedish and German translators of the Edda
have adopted the names indifferently without assigning any
reason.</p>

<h2>THE GODS OF THE NORTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">ARGUMENT OF THE POEM.</span></h2>

<p>The Asar (Gods), and the Jetter (Giants), represent the two conflicting
powers of nature; the former represent the <i>creative embellishing</i> power;
the latter the <i>defacing destructive</i> one. Lok<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> vacillates between both, as
the <i>variable spirit</i> of time. He proposes to Thor to travel to Jotunheim
(abode of the giants), without the knowledge of Odin, in order to punish
the arrogance of the giants. Thor is mystified in the subterranean world,
and obliged to return unsuccessful; but he makes two young people happy,
and elevates them to the rank of gods, because they left their home and
parents, and confided themselves implicitly to him. He again forms the
resolution of revenging himself on the giants for their presumption, and endeavours
to catch the serpent of Midgard. He travels this time with the
consent of Odin, and without Lok. Now he shows himself in the plenitude
of his power, and is on the point of catching the Serpent, when it is saved
by the giant Hymir. In his disappointment, Thor loses his hammer
Miölner.</p>

<p>In the mean while Lok pays court to Sif, the wife of Thor, but meets
with a contemptuous repulse; to revenge himself, he cuts off her hair while
she is asleep. Compelled by Thor and Frey, he procures from the Dvergar
(dwarfs), new hair for Sif spun from gold, a new hammer for Thor, the
steed Gyllinbörste for Frey, and the ring Drupner for Odin.</p>

<p>Now it happens shortly after, that Lok sets out on an adventure with
Odin and Hœnir; but he is caught by the giant Thiasse, who compels him
to carry off Iduna from Valhalla, which he willingly undertakes, in order
to mortify the gods. With Iduna vanish health, strength, beauty and
youth from Valhalla; the gods lose their power. The Nornor (fates),
being consulted, announce to them, that “bravery with the help of love
shall compel time to fidelity, and blooming life again return to Valhalla.”
Now Thor compels Lok to bring back Iduna, and Freya lends to him her
falcon’s wings for that purpose. During Iduna’s absence, Freya has lost
her husband Odur, who deserted her, because her youth and beauty had
vanished. Skada forces her way into Valhalla, and obtains Niord for a
husband. Frey, having nothing to do, ascends to Hlidskialf, which is now
no longer brilliant, and where hitherto none but Odin dared to repair. He
finds himself punished for his temerity by beholding a beautiful mountain-damsel
(a rare exception), of whom he becomes violently enamoured. Now
Iduna returns to Valhalla, and with her return health, youth and beauty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[lxxix]</a></span>
the gods. The gods are described; the joys of Valhalla; the palaces of
heaven; the Einherier. Starkodder arrives in Valhalla, and is raised to
the rank of a god. Bragur sings a song in honour of Gefion. The love of
Frey for Gerda brings to pass a reconciliation between the gods and giants.
Skirnir, Frey’s messenger, consoles his master, by reminding him of Odin’s
own amours. He travels on his master’s account to the abode of the beloved
damsel, overcomes all difficulties, solves the riddles of the giants,
shows to Gerda the portrait of Frey, and softens her heart. Her father
gives his consent, on condition that Frey shall cede to him his sword.
During his travels, Skirnir has likewise procured for Odin a chain, wherewith
to bind the wolf Fenris. On the marriage day of Gerda, the wolf is
bound, but Tyr loses his hand. In this manner the operative influence of
the giants on the gods is made manifest. The rash Tyr defies the brave
Thor; Thor becomes angry, revenges himself on the innocent human race,
and repents his anger. The marriage of Gerda is celebrated a second time
at the palace of Ægir, god of the sea. There Lok, enraged at the captivity
of Fenris, and his own expulsion from the banquet, endeavours to spoil the
joy of the meeting, insults the gods, and is compelled to fly. Banished, and
weary of wandering about, he again earnestly desires to visit Valhalla, and
promises, in order to atone for his effrontery, to procure for Thor the true
hammer Miölner from the giant-king Thrymur. Thrymur consents to
restore the hammer, but only on condition of Freya becoming his bride.
Lok brings this message to Valhalla, after the Alfer had procured for him
his pardon from the Asar. Vexed at the contempt of Thor, and seeing the
possibility of doing a treacherous action, he gives way to the temptation,
and through the means of Heimdal persuades the Asar to a stratagem; so
that Thor, dressed as Freya, goes down into Utgard. When Thor is in
Utgard, and the hammer Miölner is placed in his lap, he revenges himself
by slaying all the giants, except the old ones and the children, who remain
concealed in the deepest recesses of the mountain with Utgard-Lok. Then
arises from the vapour of the blood a remarkably tall female figure, sent by
Alfader. She prophecies the fall of Valhalla, the death of Balder, the
torments of Lok, the approaching destruction of the universe, and the punishment
of the gods for their deceit; which is, that their existence shall
for a time pass away, and the whole creation perish by fire. After this,
she consoles them with the assurance of a future life, where innocence and
bliss are to reign eternally.</p>

<div class="verse">A story wonderful to hear</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Recorded stands in ancient runes;</div>
<div class="verse">Now to my golden harp give ear,</div>

<div class="verse">The strange events, which yet remain</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Unravell’d of the Asar bright,</div>

<div class="verse">Th’ eternal wars, the deadly hate</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus sang in days of yore a Scald,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And I from him repeat the song:</div>
<div class="verse">A land there is, Trudvanger call’d,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Where frowns a castle huge and strong:</div>
<div class="verse">This building boasts its massive walls,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And many a spacious colonnade;</div>
<div class="verse">Its forty and five hundred halls</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With silver or with gold inlaid.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">How many forests, lakes and fields</div>
<div class="verse indent2">On every side this pile surround!</div>
<div class="verse">The roof is tiled with copper shields,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Which shed a dazzling lustre round.</div>
<div class="verse">Therein the mighty Asa dwells,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Whom mortals term the god of war;</div>
<div class="verse">Odin excepted, he excels</div>
<div class="verse indent2">All other gods: his name is Thor.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Around his waist a belt he wears,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And gloves of steel his hands protect;</div>
<div class="verse">Miölner, a hammer vast, he bears,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When in the fight he stands erect.</div>
<div class="verse">That belt a tenfold power doth give,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When round his loins he girds it tight;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor doth the foe remain alive,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">On whom his hammer haps to light.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Late vanquish’d by the Asar brave,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Excluded from the solar ray,</div>
<div class="verse">Bound in the mountain’s deepest cave,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In fetters Lok of Utgard lay.</div>
<div class="verse">But vain the giant monarch’s doom,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Naught can his stubborn hate control;</div>
<div class="verse">Here in the midst of cold and gloom</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Fresh thoughts of vengeance fire his soul.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Like singed threads his chains he rends,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Bursts through the surface of the earth,</div>
<div class="verse">To Upsala his course he bends,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Of Northern gods the sacred hearth;</div>
<div class="verse">He there extinguishes the fire,</div>

<div class="verse">This deed excites great Odin’s ire;</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Each at the council board, I ween,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Gave the advice that seem’d him fit:</div>
<div class="verse">But Thor with hand beneath his chin</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Lost in reflection seem’d to sit.</div>
<div class="verse">Much did the hero muse and scan,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">How best to punish Loki’s crime,</div>
<div class="verse">And by some well-concerted plan</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To crush the Lord of Jotunheim.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To rove in search of glorious war</div>
<div class="verse indent2">This Asa chief finds much delight,</div>
<div class="verse">High seated in his golden car</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Drawn by two goats of colour white.</div>
<div class="verse">Earth well may tremble with dismay,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When through the skies this chariot rolls,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But ’mongst the Asar one call’d Lok</div>

<div class="verse indent2">To lacerate his neighbours’ fame.</div>
<div class="verse">Howe’er he shine in outward grace,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Hollow and false is all within:</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With scorpion wit and envious tongue</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Though oft he gives the Asar pain,</div>
<div class="verse">Still his arch jests and gibing song</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Compel them strait to laugh again:</div>
<div class="verse">His features fair are own’d by all,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But all his mind perverse deplore;</div>
<div class="verse">He takes his seat in Odin’s hall</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Upon the bench next Asa-Thor.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>

<div class="verse indent2">With breast of lily, cheek of pink,</div>
<div class="verse">To all th’ Einherier in their turn</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Now bear around th’ immortal drink.</div>
<div class="verse">The largest horn high-fill’d with mead</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Was drain’d by Thor the chieftain bold:</div>
<div class="verse">And then to seek his goats he sped,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And yoke them to his car of gold.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He grasps his hammer, mounts his car,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And bids Lok place him by his side;</div>
<div class="verse">The thunders roar, the lightnings glare,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">As down the vault of heaven they glide!</div>
<div class="verse">Heimdaller views them roll along,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And greets with trumpet loud and shrill:</div>
<div class="verse">The seven virgins<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> tune their song,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And Thor salute with gracious smile.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Lok on fraud and guile intent,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thus Thor address’d: “Methinks, ’tis time</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Our bitter foes to circumvent,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And quell the powers of Jotunheim;</div>
<div class="verse">Thou mayst defy the force of fire,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And laugh to scorn the earthquake’s shock;</div>
<div class="verse">Feelest thou not a strong desire</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For once to visit Utgard Lok?”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Thor: “My corslet braves the steel;</div>

<div class="verse">And, be he dwarf or giant fell,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Whom Miölner strikes, it ends his pains.”</div>
<div class="verse">Now to the earth they swift descend;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The birds sing gaily in the wood,</div>
<div class="verse">And every flower its head doth bend,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Owning the presence of a god.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The sun now sinks beneath the main,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The night obscures its parting rays;</div>
<div class="verse">Rolling athwart the starry plain,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The moon its silver disk displays:</div>
<div class="verse">Two funeral mounds appear in sight:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Then first the eyes of Asa Thor</div>
<div class="verse">Glisten’d in triumph. Late at night</div>
<div class="verse indent2">They stand a peasant’s hut before.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They ask for shelter; lowly bows</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The peasant, and replies: “My lords!</div>
<div class="verse">You’re welcome here to seek repose;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But little else my roof affords.”</div>
<div class="verse">They needs must stoop to enter through</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The cottage door; and there they found</div>
<div class="verse">The peasant’s wife and daughter too</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Sitting the lowly hearth around.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The daughter was a graceful maid</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With azure eyes and golden hair.</div>
<div class="verse">They rose; and thus the matron said:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">“Alas! but meagre is our fare:</div>
<div class="verse">Mere roots and herbs our meal supply;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">No flesh invigorates our blood.”</div>
<div class="verse">“Fear not! This night shall be no lack of food.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">See now the giant-queller raise</div>
<div class="verse indent2">His hammer! lo! his goats he slew!</div>
<div class="verse">Such was his custom: with amaze,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Yet not displeased this act to view,</div>
<div class="verse">The old dame stared; then rushed in haste</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Upon the board to spread the cloth;</div>
<div class="verse">While Lok, as cook, prepared to baste</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The meat, and mix the savoury broth.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A wondrous fact I now reveal:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thor drives these goats around the earth,</div>
<div class="verse">And slays them for his nightly meal,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When no provisions cheer the hearth.</div>
<div class="verse">This done, their skins and bones he takes,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And casts them in a corner strait:</div>
<div class="verse">And lo! those goats, when he awakes,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Again stand living at the gate.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">See from the wood the peasant’s son</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Laden with faggots now appear!</div>
<div class="verse">He piles them on the hearth: anon</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The smoking steaks the trav’llers cheer:</div>
<div class="verse">No dish had they; Thor’s buckler broad</div>
<div class="verse indent2">This want supplied: and now they feed</div>
<div class="verse">With hearty zest, while the goats’ blood</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Furnish’d to all delicious mead.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">No sooner was the supper past,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thor rose observant of his rite;</div>
<div class="verse">The bones within the skins he cast;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">This did not ’scape the urchin’s sight:</div>
<div class="verse">His liquorish tooth would fain partake</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Of daintier food than met the eye;</div>
<div class="verse">So unperceived a bone he brake,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And suck’d the marrow greedily.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The morning dawn’d: with choral strain</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The feather’d songsters fill the skies:</div>
<div class="verse">The sun ascends: the travellers twain</div>
<div class="verse indent2">From slumbers light refresh’d arise.</div>
<div class="verse">To war and bold adventure prone,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Each buckles on his armour strait,</div>
<div class="verse">And whets his weapon on the stone,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That stands without the cottage gate.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As in the car the Asar sprung,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The urchin’s trick was manifest;</div>
<div class="verse">One goat limp’d heavily along,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">As if with lameness sore oppress’d.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></div>
<div class="verse">Thor was enraged; his colour fled;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He bit his lips; his eyes flash’d fire;</div>
<div class="verse">Well might the wretched peasant dread</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For wife and child the chieftain’s ire.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But more so, when he saw the chief</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Brandish on high his hammer vast:</div>
<div class="verse">The danger threaten’d, no relief</div>
<div class="verse indent2">At hand; with fear he stood aghast:</div>
<div class="verse">Then, kneeling down, he humbly sued</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Forgiveness for the stripling’s guile,</div>
<div class="verse">Offering all he had: the God</div>
<div class="verse indent2">At such an offer well might smile.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Relenting at the peasant’s prayer,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And pitying his extreme distress,</div>
<div class="verse">He bade him rise with friendly air,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And gave his hand in pledge of peace.</div>
<div class="verse">“If to my care thou wilt confide</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Those children stout,” said Asa-Thor,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<div class="verse">“I will for all their wants provide,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And teach them both the art of war.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Pleased to escape with a whole skin,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">This offer glad the swain embraced:</div>
<div class="verse">Lok gave to each a javelin,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And strait their limbs in armour laced:</div>
<div class="verse">Their glist’ning eyes the joy reveal</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Of Tialfe bold, and Roska bright:</div>
<div class="verse">To serve the God how proud they feel,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And court the perils of the fight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Lord of Trudvang now design’d</div>
<div class="verse indent2">On foot to seek the giant’s lair:</div>

<div class="verse">Impatient of delay, he fain</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Would march direct to Jotunheim.</div>
<div class="verse">They journey on o’er many a plain,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And rivers cross, and mountains climb.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And now can I assert with truth,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Tialfe became a warrior good;</div>
<div class="verse">No son of earth could e’er this youth</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Surpass in zeal and fortitude:</div>
<div class="verse">His strength by Thor was duly prized,</div>

<div class="verse">Now marching on, the tedious way</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With pensive look</div>
<div class="verse">In Valaskialf sits Asa-Lok:</div>
<div class="verse">His head hangs down; his spirits fail;</div>
<div class="verse">To cheer him naught Valhalla’s joys avail:</div>
<div class="verse">The mead hath lost its wonted zest;</div>
<div class="verse">Sâhrimner’s flesh he scorns to taste.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Naught good his gloomy look betides;</div>
<div class="verse">The Asar he unceasingly derides.</div>
<div class="verse">Whene’er on Asa-Thor he thinks,</div>
<div class="verse">His dusky front in wrinkles sinks.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“On fresh adventure art thou started,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou mighty one!</div>

<div class="verse">Naught of thy plan hast thou to Lok imparted.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He cannot easily digest</div>
<div class="verse">Such slights: his soul can find no rest:</div>
<div class="verse">Nowhere he feels at home:</div>
<div class="verse">And longs once more through the wide world to roam.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Tis flattering to his pride</div>
<div class="verse">In arms to follow Asa-Thor,</div>
<div class="verse">And carry, by the hero’s side,</div>
<div class="verse">The iron gauntlets of the god of war.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As round the oak fast twining thrives</div>
<div class="verse">The mistletoe, that supple parasite,</div>
<div class="verse">And strength and growth therefrom derives:</div>
<div class="verse">Thus Asa-Lok, the artful wight,</div>
<div class="verse">Clings to the god, although with hate</div>
<div class="verse">He views him; hoping some bright beam</div>
<div class="verse">Of Thor’s renown on him may gleam,</div>
<div class="verse">And shed some lustre on his humbler state.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As, gleaning from the sun its light,</div>
<div class="verse">The moon dispels the gloom of night:</div>
<div class="verse">Thus doth the cunning Loptur aim</div>
<div class="verse">To shine with Aucthor’s borrow’d fame:</div>
<div class="verse">While Askur’s race know not the truth,</div>
<div class="verse">And equal homage pay to both.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He sits at th’ entrance of a grot:</div>
<div class="verse">A stream transparent murmurs near.</div>
<div class="verse">To bathe in this sequester’d spot</div>
<div class="verse">The lovely Disar oft repair.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">By cowardice and treachery</div>
<div class="verse">Alone is Loptur known to fame;</div>
<div class="verse">The Disar all abhor his name,</div>
<div class="verse">And ever from his presence fly:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Love’s arrows keen he oft doth prove,</div>
<div class="verse">But never meets return of love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now towards the brook th’ Asynior pass;</div>
<div class="verse">They dance in couples on the grass.</div>
<div class="verse">With Siofna her beloved child</div>
<div class="verse">See Freya dance in measure wild!</div>
<div class="verse">See Eir Iduna fond embrace,</div>
<div class="verse">And o’er the mead the mystic circle trace!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now as in mazy rounds they wheel,</div>
<div class="verse">Their robes fall off, and all their charms reveal.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Loptur from his lurking place</div>
<div class="verse">Gloats on each feature, charm, and grace;</div>
<div class="verse">His ravish’d eyes at leisure scan</div>
<div class="verse">All that can tempt the heart of man:</div>
<div class="verse">The semi-globes of each voluptuous breast,</div>
<div class="verse">The well turn’d haunches, and the slender waist:</div>
<div class="verse">The Disar little thought that Lok</div>
<div class="verse">Enjoy’d the sight with prying look.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Like swans they sail adown the stream,</div>
<div class="verse">Attended by their handmaids fair:</div>
<div class="verse">Like birds of passage now they seem,</div>
<div class="verse">Who seek a softer clime and milder air.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now round each other’s loins their arms they wreathe;</div>
<div class="verse">Like wild ducks now they dive the stream beneath:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Their snow-white arms they oft employ,</div>
<div class="verse">Like fishes’ fins, to stem the wave;</div>
<div class="verse">The wave transported foams with joy,</div>
<div class="verse">Such graceful-fashion’d limbs to lave.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But who of these in Loptur’s eyes</div>
<div class="verse">In beauty bears away the prize?</div>
<div class="verse">Thor’s consort, Sif, he most admires;</div>
<div class="verse">For ne’er his roving eyes could find</div>
<div class="verse">Such beauty with such strength combined:</div>
<div class="verse">His veins with wildest flames she fires.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In charms this goddess yields to none,</div>
<div class="verse">Except to Freya; she alone</div>
<div class="verse">(To whom Alfader, when he meant</div>
<div class="verse">To fill the world with ravishment,</div>
<div class="verse">Gave life and being) doth surpass</div>
<div class="verse">Fair Sif in beauty and in grace.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sif cannot boast that mild soft beam</div>
<div class="verse">In th’ azure eye, that melts all hearts,</div>
<div class="verse">E’en like the moon, when it imparts</div>
<div class="verse">To beechen grove its silver gleam;</div>
<div class="verse">Strong limb’d and with majestic mien,</div>
<div class="verse">She shines a lofty heroine;</div>
<div class="verse">And Sif all tongues aloud proclaim</div>
<div class="verse">A true high-minded northern dame.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Her shoulders broad so milky white,</div>
<div class="verse">Her juicy, plump, and well-turn’d arms</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Are fit for love’s or war’s alarms,</div>
<div class="verse">T’ embrace, or to defend her right.</div>
<div class="verse">These shoulders fascinate Lok’s eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">He views her with extreme surprize;</div>
<div class="verse">Her haughty look excites in him</div>
<div class="verse">A passion never felt before;</div>
<div class="verse">With gloating eye he scans each limb,</div>
<div class="verse">And sinks a slave to Astrild’s power.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The arches of her eye-brows meet;</div>
<div class="verse">This would all other dames disfigure;</div>
<div class="verse">But naught doth this her charms defeat,</div>
<div class="verse">But adds to each peculiar vigour:</div>
<div class="verse">For in her awe-inspiring gaze</div>
<div class="verse">Her lofty soul itself pourtrays.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Proud and indifferent to desire,</div>
<div class="verse">No passion seems her breast to fire;</div>
<div class="verse">Not small her hands, but dainty white</div>
<div class="verse">Like swan’s-down, or new fallen-snow;</div>
<div class="verse">Her nails like polish’d almonds grow;</div>
<div class="verse">On well-turn’d feet her tow’ring height</div>
<div class="verse">Securely stands; her hair loose streaming</div>
<div class="verse">Down to her feet descends, with golden radiance gleaming.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Behind the bush conceal’d,</div>
<div class="verse">Are all these charms to Lok reveal’d.</div>
<div class="verse">Then thus he thought: What pleasure should I prove</div>
<div class="verse">To be encircled by such arms!</div>
<div class="verse">To taste all those luxurious charms,</div>
<div class="verse">And in the beechen grove&mdash;revel in joy and love!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Close to my lips those coral lips I’d glue,</div>
<div class="verse">Those lips, which offer to my ravish’d view</div>
<div class="verse">Teeth fine as pearls, and whiter far, I trow,</div>
<div class="verse">Than any beast of prey can show.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">What tumult fires my blood!</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! that I could,</div>
<div class="verse">While Thor is gone a-fishing far,</div>
<div class="verse">Fish him to shame in the same bath with her!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus thinks the lustful treach’rous elf,</div>
<div class="verse">And still behind the bush conceals himself:</div>
<div class="verse">For Sif her dwelling soon will seek,</div>
<div class="verse">Which lies midst Dovre’s rocks so bleak,</div>
<div class="verse">Where fir-trees undulate with many a spire:</div>
<div class="verse">Her robes resuming quick, the Disa veils</div>
<div class="verse">Each charm, while passion Loptur’s breast assails</div>
<div class="verse">With still increasing fire.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She claps her helm her golden locks upon,</div>
<div class="verse">Which, moisten’d by the wave, less brilliant shone.</div>
<div class="verse">Now far inland she climbs the mountain steep:</div>
<div class="verse">Lok follows after cautious and unseen.</div>
<div class="verse">Arrived at her abode in the sequester’d glen,</div>
<div class="verse">The rustling waterfall lulls Sifia soon to sleep.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The wind invading now the bower</div>
<div class="verse">With burning kisses dries her hair,</div>
<div class="verse">And gives back to those tresses fair</div>
<div class="verse">Their golden tinge and magic power.</div>

<div class="verse">Now more iron the crew on the anvil threw,</div>

<div class="verse">When the hammer for Thor, fit weapon of war,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Next a female dwarf took a lump of gold,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus she sang, and with glee now she bent the knee,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now on Sifia fair Thor fasten’d the hair;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It took root like sea-weed on rocks:</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At Valhalla’s Ting to Odin the ring</div>

<div class="verse">As vanish ’fore the wind the vapours light,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus sinks each action of the human race</div>
<div class="verse">Into th’ abyss of sempiternal night;</div>
<div class="verse">One billow sinks; another mounts apace:</div>
<div class="verse">Alternate peace coquetting plays with war;</div>
<div class="verse">Now in the sheath the glaive inglorious lies,</div>
<div class="verse">And now with glitt’ring menace flouts the air:</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis all a juggle&mdash;a butterfly, that hies</div>
<div class="verse">Careless from flower to flower&mdash;pairs with its kind&mdash;and dies.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Why boast in fight thy prowess, warrior wild?</div>
<div class="verse">What was it? scum&mdash;mere froth upon the sea</div>
<div class="verse">Of time&mdash;self-love impell’d thee&mdash;fortune smiled&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Thy docile troop must needs their Chief obey.</div>
<div class="verse">But come, lay bare thy heart! and at the shrine</div>
<div class="verse">Of truth confess! (concealment now were shame)</div>
<div class="verse">Where is the merit of that act of thine,</div>
<div class="verse">That made thee rival of thy father’s fame?</div>
<div class="verse">That thou didst death defy? Doth not a beast the same?</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>

<div class="verse">Where Timour pulverized in days of yore</div>
<div class="verse">Whole hecatombs of foes at Samarcand,</div>
<div class="verse">The loose sand whirls in eddies as before.</div>
<div class="verse">Nor of that triumph doth one record stand:</div>
<div class="verse">The meadows still display their emerald sheen,</div>
<div class="verse">Forgetful of the day, when frantic war</div>
<div class="verse">With streams of blood incarnadined the green;</div>
<div class="verse">No longer now the traveller’s vision scare</div>
<div class="verse">Huge piles of human sculls, long since dispersed in air.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And who art thou whose quenchless thirst of fame</div>
<div class="verse">Thus furiously lays waste th’ affrighted earth?</div>
<div class="verse">Not near so puissant as the nightly flame,</div>

<div class="verse">The harden’d lava-streams <i>its</i> force attest,</div>
<div class="verse">And though a thousand long long years have fled,</div>
<div class="verse">Give to the swelling grape its poignant zest:</div>
<div class="verse">Thy deed, like ashes, moulders with the dead;</div>
<div class="verse">The ravens on thy fame, as on thy limbs, have fed.</div>

<div class="verse">Yet do not thou crow neither, little gnome</div>

<div class="verse">Lookst down securely on the fight, and smilest,</div>
<div class="verse">As looks the lamb upon the wolf below:</div>
<div class="verse">Who thinkst the awl a better instrument</div>
<div class="verse">Than Aukthor’s hammer: thou requirest too</div>
<div class="verse">Iduna’s apple, if thou beest intent</div>
<div class="verse">To reach thy labour’s goal, and shine pre-eminent.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>

<div class="verse">No real hero will thy blessing fail,</div>

<div class="verse">Heimdal, who on his rainbow stood betimes</div>
<div class="verse">Shining amidst his seven colours bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Discover’d frightful witches mutt’ring rhimes</div>

<div class="verse">Now Skada, mounted on her glander’d horse,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose nostrils, frightful snorting, taint the gale,</div>
<div class="verse">Each night uncheck’d pursues her baneful course:</div>

<div class="verse">He to his anchor needs recourse must have,</div>
<div class="verse">Behold! the cable stiff with frozen air</div>
<div class="verse">Cannot be bent: death rides upon the wave,</div>

<div class="verse">When summer came, no sunbeam cheer’d the vale;</div>
<div class="verse">Like slave, the wretched swain must groan and sweat:</div>
<div class="verse">His house, his tools, his clothing he must sell;</div>
<div class="verse">His only thoughts were rye, and oats, and wheat:</div>
<div class="verse">He had forgotten quite to bend the knee</div>
<div class="verse">In humble duty fore Alfader’s throne:</div>
<div class="verse">His horse was far more dignified than he;</div>
<div class="verse">He felt with inward pang, and needs must own</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">No longer now the warriors, as before,</div>

<div class="verse">He drew the milk so bountiful, so pure;</div>
<div class="verse">His only nurses now were prejudice</div>
<div class="verse">And discord, each a foul-mouth’d envious quean:</div>
<div class="verse">His aim is now, deep grovelling in vice,</div>
<div class="verse">To please the multitude with jest obscene,</div>
<div class="verse">To flatter or to mock, calumniate and feign.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>

<div class="verse">Once Saga sat, and on her shield engraved</div>
<div class="verse">Each act of virtue generous, good, and great:</div>
<div class="verse">Of graver and of buckler now bereaved,</div>

<div class="verse">The fond devotion to the public weal,</div>
<div class="verse">The scenes of Nidaros and Leir in vain</div>

<div class="verse">And Balder, gentle-hearted as a maid,</div>

<div class="verse">There, as a shepherd watches o’er his flock,</div>

<div class="verse">Thick murky vapours an unwholesome veil</div>
<div class="verse">Spread o’er the tree, and glide with motion fleet</div>
<div class="verse">O’er rock, and marsh, o’er forest, hill, and dale:</div>

<div class="verse">Fragments of stone with ivy overspread</div>
<div class="verse">Choke up the passage to the silent dell,</div>
<div class="verse">To all impervious, but the Asar dread:</div>
<div class="verse">Berries and flowers the sacred fount conceal;</div>
<div class="verse">Pine forests thick around each eye profane repel.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But every growth was blighted! and behold</div>
<div class="verse">On the stream’s brink the Norna Skulda sat,</div>
<div class="verse">With finger on her lips, and aspect cold,</div>
<div class="verse">The awful guardian of the book of fate:</div>
<div class="verse">Omniscient queen, whose mind can fathom all</div>
<div class="verse">That to Alfader’s self remains unknown.</div>
<div class="verse">Enormous wings adown her shoulders fall:</div>
<div class="verse">A fillet broad upon her forehead shone,</div>
<div class="verse">With many a mystic rune and strange device thereon.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Green was her garment; towards the fountain now,</div>
<div class="verse">Now towards the days to come she turns her eye.</div>
<div class="verse">Wrapp’d in a sable shroud with tranquil brow,</div>
<div class="verse">But with averted face, sits Urda nigh.</div>
<div class="verse">Here with her sisters twain Verdandis too,</div>
<div class="verse">Mistress of time, resides: her garment bright</div>
<div class="verse">Was interwov’n with scales of various hue.</div>
<div class="verse">These females all are of gigantic height;</div>
<div class="verse">None dare dispute their will; resistless is their might.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sleep never ventures here: the Nornor’s eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Do never close, whether the mid-day sun</div>
<div class="verse">Or radiant stars illuminate the skies:</div>
<div class="verse">Awake they sit, though motionless like stone.</div>
<div class="verse">Urda the actions of the past unveils;</div>
<div class="verse">Skulda the future cons with prudence meet:</div>
<div class="verse">Meanwhile Verdandis weighs in golden scales</div>
<div class="verse">The present gifts, the gods to send think fit,</div>
<div class="verse">A sceptre or a grave; a triumph or defeat.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Immovable they sit, mute as the grave,</div>
<div class="verse">Like sphinx of marble on the Theban plain;</div>
<div class="verse">While shine reflected in the limpid wave</div>
<div class="verse">The figures of the awful virgin train.</div>
<div class="verse">Impatient the decrees of fate to learn</div>
<div class="verse">Oft to this grove the proud Valkyrior come;</div>
<div class="verse">With questions sharp assail the Nornor stern,</div>
<div class="verse">Then soar aloft, through the wide world to roam,</div>
<div class="verse">And fill the troubled air with strange prophetic doom.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus Mimer to the lofty Skulda spoke:</div>
<div class="verse">“O thou! who feelest neither joy nor woe,</div>
<div class="verse">Hostile to none, friendly to none; whose look,</div>
<div class="verse">Like that of falcon ardent, can pierce through</div>
<div class="verse">The blackest night, whether the dove doth coo,</div>
<div class="verse">Or the sword clash, alike unmoved; my prayer</div>
<div class="verse">Do not reject! and O resolve me true</div>
<div class="verse">The great enigma! shall Iduna fair</div>
<div class="verse">Again, freed from her chains, respire her natal air?”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The virgin breast of Skulda swell’d awhile:</div>
<div class="verse">What marble seem’d, now moved with high pulsation;</div>
<div class="verse">She gazed on Mimer; and he thought, a smile</div>
<div class="verse">Play’d on her mouth; it gave him consolation.</div>
<div class="verse">Urda’s fount ceased to rustle through the dell;</div>
<div class="verse">From Skulda’s lips resounds this solemn strain:</div>
<div class="verse">“When bravery shall fickle time compel</div>
<div class="verse">To constancy, and fast the recreant chain,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the wings of love health shall fly home again.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She spoke. In sable clouds Night veils her brow;</div>
<div class="verse">And sooth’d with hope, Earth’s bosom gently heaves:</div>
<div class="verse">The fount calls to its water: “Swell and flow!”</div>
<div class="verse">The blast loud whistles through the arid leaves.</div>
<div class="verse">Homeward with joy now hie the Asar twain,</div>
<div class="verse">For well the Nornor’s speech they comprehend:</div>
<div class="verse">They oft repeat the heart-consoling strain,</div>
<div class="verse">While floating in the air they swift ascend,</div>
<div class="verse">And eager still their course towards bright Valhalla bend.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When bravery shall fickle time compel</div>
<div class="verse">To constancy, shall health fly home again</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the wings of love.” Thus through the dell</div>
<div class="verse">Re-echoed wide the solemn Nornor’s strain.</div>
<div class="verse">“What other god but Thor can solve this spell?</div>
<div class="verse">Juggler of time is Lok, we all agree;</div>
<div class="verse">And Thor alone can Lok subdue&mdash;tis well&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The Queen of Love preserves the prison key,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">These words were ponder’d oft the gods among;</div>
<div class="verse">Thor seized their import; red as blood his cheek</div>
<div class="verse">With anger, from his bench he quickly sprung,</div>
<div class="verse">And grasp’d the pallid Loptur by the neck:</div>
<div class="verse">And lo! as round the spindle turns the wheel,</div>
<div class="verse">When busy housewife spins her flax with glee,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus Thor twirl’d Lok around from head to heel;</div>
<div class="verse">And now he touch’d the moon, and now the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">While at the caitiff’s screams the gods laugh’d heartily.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>

<div class="verse">A spacious chamber met his eyes hewn in the cavern grey;</div>
<div class="verse">Therein reclining on a couch a beauteous damsel lay:</div>
<div class="verse">In slumbers light indulged the maid so innocent and meek;</div>
<div class="verse">The blush of morning tinged with red her alabaster cheek.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Careless reposed her graceful arm across her forehead bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Her raven locks in ringlets twined between her fingers white;</div>
<div class="verse">Her small white hand quite buried seem’d i’ th’ streaming coal-black hair,</div>

<div class="verse">And quite forgets Iduna’s loss, and all Valhalla’s woe.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But while he gazed, his longing eyes witness’d a wondrous sight!</div>
<div class="verse">For now to white the red was changed! and red became the white!</div>

<div class="verse">Two rows of teeth, as bright as pearls or ivory, they unfold!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And when the tunic fell aside with the pulsation strong,</div>
<div class="verse">Up from the lovely damsel’s breast a pair of rose-buds sprung!</div>

<div class="verse">But strict their duty to fulfil the parted fingers fail.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now rising from her couch she flies, as nimble as a roe,</div>
<div class="verse">To where a fountain’s limpid stream adown the rock doth flow:</div>
<div class="verse">She bathes her cheek, her large dark eyes and eke her snow-white arms</div>
<div class="verse">A genial glow, unfelt before, the favour’d fountain warms.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In order not to lose its strength, between the rocks it ran</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The blind too, who had lifted up their eyelids oft in vain,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She takes out from a case a comb of burnish’d gold so rare,</div>

<div class="verse">She wreath’d a band of twisted hair around her forehead high,</div>
<div class="verse">Adorn’d with sapphires blue, which shone with wondrous brilliancy:</div>
<div class="verse">She then put on a costly robe of asbest silver white;</div>
<div class="verse">The border of the robe was hemm’d with garnets rare and bright.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A milk-tub made of polish’d deal he saw her take up now,</div>
<div class="verse">And to the flow’ry mead repair, to milk her brindled cow:</div>
<div class="verse">In clover deep there grazing stood the cow with crumpled horn;</div>
<div class="verse">I’ th’ middle of the meadow spread its blossom the black thorn.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She sat down on the clover green, and with her fingers neat</div>
<div class="verse">Under the cow she fix’d the pail, and grasp’d the swelling teat;</div>
<div class="verse">While the milk foam’d, the beast to stare with much indifference seem’d:</div>
<div class="verse">“O thou cold-hearted stupid cow!” thus Asa Frey exclaim’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">His look the graceful Jotun nymph now follow’d ev’rywhere;</div>
<div class="verse">He sigh’d: “I ne’er before beheld a maid so wondrous fair.”</div>
<div class="verse">His words she heard, but innocence dwell’d in her radiant eye,</div>
<div class="verse">And intellect was deeply stamp’d upon her forehead high.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Her cheek a glow unusual felt; bewitchingly she smiled;</div>
<div class="verse">With piety and steady faith was fill’d her bosom mild:</div>
<div class="verse">He saw her then sit down to spin, and much admired the zeal,</div>
<div class="verse">With which her younger sisters all she taught to turn the wheel.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Her arms around her much-loved sire with tenderness she flung;</div>
<div class="verse">She smooth’d his beard, and ’gainst the wall his bow and quiver hung:</div>
<div class="verse">When from the forest home he came, she piled the hearth with logs;</div>
<div class="verse">And in the milk put many a slice of bread to feed his dogs.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Heath-cocks, wild ducks, and partridges upon the dresser lie:</div>
<div class="verse">No more they now the thrushes’ song disturb with piercing cry:</div>
<div class="verse">The hare too, who such speed had shown, how changed! with legs stretch’d out,</div>
<div class="verse">Now stiff and cold he lies, while blood drips from his mangled throat.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Gerda took from out a case a diamond of great worth,</div>
<div class="verse">The like was never seen before i’ th’ mountains of the north,</div>
<div class="verse">For if into the darkest room ’twas brought i’ th’ hour of night,</div>
<div class="verse">And placed upon the hearth, it shed around a dazzling light.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now with her apron round her waist the giant-maiden stands,</div>
<div class="verse">The fire fierce burning hardens not her delicate white hands;</div>
<div class="verse">Her breast lost not its lily hue; her cheek was not more brown;</div>
<div class="verse">That she was giant-born, could all infer from that alone.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Towards evening to her father’s house came giants old and young,</div>
<div class="verse">To drain the bowl, and pass the night in revelry and song:</div>
<div class="verse">Some stand on hoofs of horse; while some horns on their forehead bear;</div>
<div class="verse">Others have beards of goat; the rest a loftier nature share.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For every one is well aware, that of the giant race</div>
<div class="verse">There must be many tribes distinct, of unlike form and face;</div>
<div class="verse">With human bodies some combine the head of wolf or bear;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></div>
<div class="verse">Some dwell in subterranean caves; some in the forest drear:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Others with human visage graced the Asar’s type recall;</div>
<div class="verse">They war upon the gods, ’tis true, but that comes from their fall:</div>
<div class="verse">Though not endow’d with heavenly power, magic they understand;</div>
<div class="verse">In woollen oft like peasants clad they wander through the land.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Of this last race was Gerda fair: her sire would oft invite</div>
<div class="verse">The wild Hrimthusser<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> to his board; she view’d them all with slight.</div>
<div class="verse">“Gerda’s in truth a handsome girl, ’tis pity she’s so cold:”</div>
<div class="verse">This was remark’d by Horse-leg young, and eke by Goat-beard old.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Against her robe they rubb’d themselves; they pinched her arms and thighs;</div>
<div class="verse">At this the Jotun damsel blush’d with anger and surprize.</div>
<div class="verse">“If ye cannot behave yourselves,” said she in threat’ning tone,</div>
<div class="verse">“I’ll instantly retire, and leave ye here to sup alone.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Of beauty with good sense allied so powerful is the charm,</div>
<div class="verse">The sturdy giants felt ashamed, and swore they meant no harm:</div>
<div class="verse">She fill’d their cups with foaming ale, and gave them savoury food;</div>
<div class="verse">But when their jokes obscene and coarse the giant carles renew’d,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She kiss’d her sire, and sought her bower: there stood she all alone,</div>
<div class="verse">And look’d out at the wide expanse, and gazed upon the moon:</div>
<div class="verse">She sigh’d with longing, but for what, she could not rightly tell;</div>
<div class="verse">She felt so warm, that from her breast she doff’d the silken veil.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The moon benignant shone; it seem’d towards earth its course to lower,</div>
<div class="verse">And sent strong rays of light within the lovely Gerda’s bower:</div>
<div class="verse">She thought it was the sun of night, the silver-helm-clad moon,</div>
<div class="verse">But it was Asa-Frey himself peeping from Hlidskialf’s throne.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now when, by sleep oppress’d, her limbs upon the couch she laid,</div>
<div class="verse">Frey wish’d a thousand times good night to the bewitching maid.</div>
<div class="verse">Descending then from Hlidskialf’s tower, he strait began to rove.</div>
<div class="verse">Like dreamer in the midnight hour, towards Freya’s beechen grove.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Towards Freya’s grove the love-sick god pensive pursued his way:</div>
<div class="verse">Its glories at Iduna’s rape became of frost the prey;</div>
<div class="verse">The leaves all lay in yellow heaps the wither’d trunks around;</div>
<div class="verse">The silver brook, once used to flowers, now flint-stones only found.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And now throughout the grove resounds the tempest’s awful yell!</div>
<div class="verse">Scared by the shock, the rain-drops bright from the dry branches fell!</div>
<div class="verse">So much had love absorb’d his thoughts, when this the god perceiv’d,</div>
<div class="verse">He thought each branch upon the trees, like him enamour’d, griev’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The howling of the storm amongst the trees with joy he hailed;</div>
<div class="verse">It much resembled, as he thought, the sighs his breast exhaled:</div>
<div class="verse">He knew not it was Skada’s self, that through the forest blew</div>
<div class="verse">Behind her cloud: the whole wide world appear’d to him as new.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">How dreadful was the change! now seem’d Heimkringlas dead indeed,</div>
<div class="verse">Since from its native soil was torn the life-renewing reed!</div>
<div class="verse">But it was not Iduna’s form, that Frey long’d to embrace,</div>
<div class="verse">But thee, o Gerda! scion fair of Jotun’s swarthy race.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As thus he sat immers’d in thought, sudden his eye survey’d</div>
<div class="verse">His sister Freya; there she stood in linen white array’d,</div>
<div class="verse">With silver ringlets, like a dame in the decline of life,</div>
<div class="verse">Who on her beauty’s vanish’d spring looks back with inward grief.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She heard her brother’s plaintive sigh. “Unfortunate,” she said:</div>
<div class="verse">“Why didst thou Hlidskialf’s tower ascend? hath magic turn’d thy head?</div>
<div class="verse">Were I in all my glory now a Disa, as before,</div>
<div class="verse">In the dark vales of Jotunheim naught would avail my power.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And if it could, would Odin e’er permit Frey to espouse</div>
<div class="verse">A giantess? hath he not long for Eir reclaim’d thy vows?</div>
<div class="verse">The Disa, who when Idun fair in Valhall takes her seat.</div>
<div class="verse">Gives health to all the Asar’s blood with liquor from the beet.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Odin cannot compel my choice,” her brother answer’d sore,</div>
<div class="verse">“E’en if he still possess’d his strength and glory, as before:</div>
<div class="verse">Giants to slay Thor boasts the power; but not to quench the flame,</div>
<div class="verse">Which burns impetuous in my heart for the fair mountain dame!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus the fraternal pair conversed, and shared each other’s grief;</div>
<div class="verse">But Freya breath’d the deepest sigh, despairing of relief.</div>
<div class="verse">She said: “My dearest brother! thee the future may console;</div>
<div class="verse">But as for me, no hope remains to sooth my anguish’d soul.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“For he, who hath not yet possessed what he desires, may still</div>
<div class="verse">Hope to obtain it; time one day may on his efforts smile:</div>
<div class="verse">But he, who, which he once enjoy’d, hath lost the darling bliss,</div>
<div class="verse">Looks from a height, and views below a fathomless abyss!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Alas! a Vaner I’m no more;” thus sigh’d despairing Frey;</div>
<div class="verse">“E’en were I handsome as before, when Idun’s fruit was nigh,</div>
<div class="verse">Still vanish’d is my peace of mind; no longer I’m the same;</div>
<div class="verse">Nerveless and weak I feel; and Lok, the traitor Lok’s to blame.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">While Frey thus reasons, lo! a change<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> strikes his astonish’d sight</div>
<div class="verse">The sun dispels all mist and fog! day follows upon night!</div>
<div class="verse">The frost dissolves in genial dew! azure becomes the sky!</div>
<div class="verse">And in a whirlwind from the grove the wither’d branches fly!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The trees stood full of buds! these swell’d! flowers blossom’d forth! and lo!</div>
<div class="verse">Freya now feels a pressure strange before her heart! below</div>
<div class="verse">She casts a hasty glance, and views with pleasure and surprize</div>
<div class="verse">The rose-buds on her breast again with youthful fullness rise.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Frey gazed upon the brook; of late slowly it crept ’midst stones,</div>
<div class="verse">But now through banks of violets blue with rapid course it runs:</div>
<div class="verse">The spot, where grew a noisome weed, now odours sweet exhales;</div>
<div class="verse">He look’d; and in its place, behold! a rose the air regales!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now on each other gazed the pair with mutual ecstacy;</div>
<div class="verse">Of all the females in the world the handsomest was she:</div>
<div class="verse">In him she view’d the paragon of males with rose-crown’d brow,</div>
<div class="verse">And had she ne’er felt love before, she would have felt it now.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A clapping loud of wings was heard: they look’d, and with delight</div>
<div class="verse">Beheld the stork, who with his mate had homeward wing’d his flight:</div>
<div class="verse">They had been far in southern climes<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, the swarthy tribes among;</div>
<div class="verse">What could they not relate, had they the power to use their tongue?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The stork now sought his clay-built nest all in the beechen grove:</div>
<div class="verse">Again over the daisied mead the cattle grazing rove:</div>
<div class="verse">And bursting from his tomb, soon as the sun resumed his power,</div>
<div class="verse">The butterfly each flower caress’d, himself a living flower,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The cold dissolves, while breezes mild and gentle fan the air:</div>
<div class="verse">The genial warmth was felt by Frey and by his sister fair:</div>
<div class="verse">They marvel much, and listen; on each other gaze, and sigh:</div>
<div class="verse">Hark! tones resound from Valaskialf; they were the tones of joy.</div>

<div class="verse">Great was the joy and revelry; each Asa swell’d with pride,</div>
<div class="verse">When Idun sat at the right hand of Odin, like a bride.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Before her stands the golden vase that holds the sacred fruit,</div>
<div class="verse">From which the gods the purple bloom of youth and health recruit;</div>
<div class="verse">Next to Iduna Bragur sits; his eyes with constant gaze</div>
<div class="verse">Devour her charms: thus from the sun the sun-flower drinks the rays.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Frigga the bounteous mother smiled: the Earth, deliver’d now,</div>
<div class="verse">A wreath of flowers and ears of corn had sent to grace her brow:</div>
<div class="verse">She carves Sâhrimner’s roasted flesh, and sends the slices round</div>
<div class="verse">By a young nymph, whose temples shine with golden fillet crown’d.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">’Twas Fulla, Frigga’s handmaid. Gna, who joys to mount the steed,</div>
<div class="verse">Hofvarpur hight, for every guest pours out delicious mead:</div>
<div class="verse">When bearing round the brimming horns the bright Valkyrior move,</div>
<div class="verse">The charms of those attendants fair inspire each god with love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A seat by Odin’s dexter hand just between him and Eir</div>
<div class="verse">Remain’d unoccupied; ’twas meant for Freya and for Freyr:<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></div>
<div class="verse">By Thor his consort Sif was placed; the warlike god was seen</div>
<div class="verse">Oft on the shoulders of his wife his awful front to lean.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Next them sat Heimdal; when his eyes Freya and Frey behold,</div>
<div class="verse">Smiling he draws his lip aside, and shows his tooth of gold:</div>
<div class="verse">So sharp his ears, he hears wool grow and grasses upwards shoot,</div>
<div class="verse">And well he knew what in the grove those two had talk’d about.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Next to Heimdaller Gefion sat, the proud shield-bearing maid;</div>
<div class="verse">But naught avail’d to gain her heart the courtship that he paid;</div>
<div class="verse">Like rose-bud just about to burst blooming and fresh her hue;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet with indifference profound doth she love’s pastime view.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">All the young maidens who, uncrown’d by Freya and by love,</div>
<div class="verse">By death are stricken, refuge find in Gefion’s holy grove:</div>
<div class="verse">Here they converse and oft in sport around the meadow run,</div>
<div class="verse">When cold and sharp the weather feels, and clouds obscure the sun.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Their greatest pleasure is to view each plant and flow’ret grow;</div>
<div class="verse">But in this grove no rose is pluck’d; no garlands bind their brow;</div>
<div class="verse">The fountain, where they love to bathe, is shielded well from sight</div>
<div class="verse">Profane, by a thick hedge; secure they sleep the long long night.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yet it is whisper’d, when the moon shines forth, their thoughts on love</div>
<div class="verse">Will sometimes dwell; oft stolen looks they cast towards Freya’s grove:</div>
<div class="verse">But no one may such thoughts indulge, Gefion is so severe,</div>
<div class="verse">No male, not e’en a little boy, dare in her grove appear.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In front of her a goddess sat, whose temper’s diff’rent mould</div>
<div class="verse">With that of Gefion contrast forms, as heat compared with cold:</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas gentle Siofna, whose blue eyes with love and softness beam,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis she who fills the heart of youth with the first pleasing dream.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Clad in a vest of muscle-shell, with crown of sea-weed green,</div>
<div class="verse">Sat Ægir, Ocean’s king: he drank out of a conque marine.</div>
<div class="verse">Next to him sat his consort Ran, with temper given to strife:</div>
<div class="verse">The timid Disar view with dread Ægir’s ill-favour’d wife.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Harsh-featured was her face, her look malignant, ne’er was she</div>
<div class="verse">So joyous, as when vessels sunk in the wide-yawning sea:</div>
<div class="verse">She dwells in Ocean’s deepest cave: seldom to Valhall came:</div>
<div class="verse">With pain in their bright choir enroll’d the Asar view’d her name.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With th’ Asa who sat next to her she form’d a contrast wide;</div>
<div class="verse">They seem’d the images of love and hatred side by side:</div>
<div class="verse">Twas Balder, who with youthful bloom all renovated shone:</div>
<div class="verse">The Disar all cast looks of love on Odin’s fair-hair’d son.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">His light gold tresses, parted, gleam’d over his forehead bright;</div>
<div class="verse">His brows resembled just the flower “<i>the brows of Balder</i>” hight:</div>
<div class="verse">His aspect’s majesty divine no language can impart;</div>
<div class="verse">Where’er he turn’d his eyes, their glance went deep into the heart.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The guardian of a secret grave confided to his care,</div>
<div class="verse">For which the world no language hath, nor mortal clay an ear,</div>
<div class="verse">Such Balder seem’d; spite of his mild and gentle soul, I trow,</div>
<div class="verse">If he but cast a glance on Thor, with reverence Thor must bow.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Such softness with such strength combined no Asa boasts but he;</div>
<div class="verse">Spite of his blithesome brow, it bears the stamp of sovereignty:</div>
<div class="verse">It could appease the wrath of Ran; on him she loved to gaze:</div>
<div class="verse">Then smiled she like a wave, on which a star benignant plays.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Mother of pearl and coral bright upon the board she laid:<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></div>
<div class="verse">To Nanna, Balder’s consort, she presented them, and said:</div>
<div class="verse">“Whatever mortal thou mayst chuse to rescue from the grave</div>
<div class="verse">Beneath the billow, with these gifts thou shall have power to save.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To Nanna sat just opposite Lofna with flower-crown’d brow:</div>
<div class="verse">When with thy dreams two youthful hearts, O gentle Siofna! glow,</div>
<div class="verse">Then Lofna, when invoked, to sooth the lover’s pain delights,</div>
<div class="verse">And spite of every obstacle, the amorous pair unites:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And if this union be denied on earth, affliction’s vale,</div>
<div class="verse">Aloft she bears them on her wings to Freya’s blissful hall.</div>
<div class="verse">Nanna she gave to Balder’s arms; and pitying Signe’s fate,</div>
<div class="verse">Burst Hagbarth’s noose, and from the tree bore him to Folkvang’s gate.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Hædur, fumbling through the hall, cheerless and sullen goes;</div>
<div class="verse">He mutters words in Vidar’s ears, the god with the thick shoes:</div>
<div class="verse">Stone blind is Hædur, though robust, the sovereign of the night;</div>
<div class="verse">A tunick black as jet he wears with silver stars bedight.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The secrets of eternity are all to Vidar known;</div>
<div class="verse">Their stern unflinching guardian he, amongst the gods alone,</div>
<div class="verse">Ne’er opes his mouth; his shoulders are like Aukthor’s, broad and strong,</div>
<div class="verse">And strong like Vidar is the man who can restrain his tongue.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Two gods, whose qualities on earth are seldom found allied,</div>
<div class="verse">Eternally in Odin’s hall are seated side by side:</div>
<div class="verse">Resistless is their power combined; all view them with respect;</div>
<div class="verse">Loder, the god of beauty reigns; Hænir, of intellect.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The next to Hænir on the bench the serious Var appears,</div>
<div class="verse">Stern awe-inspiring goddess, who the rod of conscience bears;</div>
<div class="verse">She hears the oaths of all mankind: whoever breaks his vow,</div>
<div class="verse">To Nastrond down she hurls the wretch, to endless wail and woe.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Near her were many vacant seats; Forsete just and stern,</div>
<div class="verse">Var’s firmest prop, will not so soon to Valaskialf return:</div>
<div class="verse">As soon as Idun was released, down to the earth he hied,</div>
<div class="verse">As judge supreme by Urda’s wave the causes to decide.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Saga Forsete’s footsteps close with graver and with shield</div>
<div class="verse">Had follow’d, to record in runes whatever time reveal’d:</div>
<div class="verse">But every morning her return the anxious gods await,</div>
<div class="verse">To hear her ’fore Alfader’s throne her narrative relate.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But Niord, to Skada married, soon the ill-match’d union rued:</div>
<div class="verse">She bade him to the nuptial-couch on Dovre’s summit rude;</div>
<div class="verse">In every corner of the rock the eddying whirlwind roars,</div>
<div class="verse">While Skada’s brother o’er the sea, the tall Vandhose, soars:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">His arms cling to the sky; his legs drop dangling o’er the wave;</div>
<div class="verse">He laughs; the seamen at his sight are fill’d with terror grave:</div>
<div class="verse">Now all at once, to water changed, he gushes down amain.</div>
<div class="verse">And all he meets in his career drives headlong down to Ran.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Skada with dishevell’d hair from Dovre’s cliffs arose;</div>
<div class="verse">She grasp’d her lance, to deal around dire wounds and mortal blows:</div>
<div class="verse">“Up! come to help me! bridegroom dear!” thus call’d she out to Niord:</div>
<div class="verse">The god turns pale with anger, when he hears her voice abhorr’d.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But luck would have it, Idun fair was on that very morn</div>
<div class="verse">Replaced in Valhall; at her sight Niord felt his strength return;</div>
<div class="verse">Like tempest from the south he rose, and vanquish’d the east-wind,</div>
<div class="verse">And Skada fled to hide herself drear Finnmark’s rocks behind.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Lately at Garderik she put in force a strange resolve;</div>
<div class="verse">With fragments of sharp ice, which should not on the tongue dissolve,</div>
<div class="verse">She fill’d her lungs; with these she sought the ambient air to freeze,</div>
<div class="verse">But Niord the mischief soon dispell’d with flower-scented breeze.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At length they peace conclude: nine days was Niord to wear the crown,</div>
<div class="verse">Healthy and free the north remain, subject to Niord alone:</div>
<div class="verse">Skada the three succeeding days might march with flag unfurl’d:</div>
<div class="verse">Thus with alternate change do Good and Evil rule the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Ere Niord to Skada was allied, the north was far more mild;</div>
<div class="verse">Often with fire from Muspelheim the northern air he fill’d:</div>
<div class="verse">But longer now the mists prevail, so doth the grim east-wind;</div>
<div class="verse">For no one boasts the power to tame Skada’s malignant mind.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">While Skada slumbers in her cave, ’tis Niord’s peculiar care</div>
<div class="verse">In arches o’er the verdant earth to mould the light-blue air;</div>
<div class="verse">And where are more delightful woods and meadows to be found,</div>
<div class="verse">Than those of Denmark, when the lays of nightingales resound?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Niord weeps with rage, while Skada fell lays waste his rich domain,</div>
<div class="verse">But changed his precious tears become to fecundating rain;</div>
<div class="verse">When rain descends, it never fails to damp the tempest’s wings;</div>
<div class="verse">Thus ever ’gainst his consort’s spells some antidote he brings.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">From Vingolf Niord was absent, when the mead was handed round,</div>
<div class="verse">For while Forsete sat as judge by Urda’s wave profound,</div>
<div class="verse">He clear’d the air from vapours foul: where’er extends his power,</div>
<div class="verse">Healthy and free each peasant breathes, sickness prevails no more.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Not far from Balder Snotra sat with mild and graceful look:</div>
<div class="verse">She blush’d, while from a silver dish small cakes her fingers took;</div>
<div class="verse">In gesture, movement, and in speech her gentle grace she blends,</div>
<div class="verse">And often to the poet’s lay her soft expression lends.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Hlyn too was there, whom Frigga sends to guard the race of men</div>
<div class="verse">From danger, when dark, Surtur spreads his snares o’er marsh and fen.</div>
<div class="verse">Next Uller sat the archer good, with bow across his loins:</div>
<div class="verse">Instead of war, to end all feuds by duel he enjoins.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Asar thus in Valaskialf their joyous vigils keep,</div>
<div class="verse">Which on the arches vast of heaven rests its foundation deep;</div>
<div class="verse">Each azure-colour’d cupola on columns doth repose;</div>
<div class="verse">Straight as the forest’s finest fir each marble column rose.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Bucklers and swords with silver hilts around these columns shone.</div>
<div class="verse">Now Bragur strikes the golden harp, and in pathetic tone</div>
<div class="verse">He sings the danger that the gods so lately had incurr’d,</div>
<div class="verse">And while he sang, Iduna’s cup pass’d round the festive board.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now far beyond Valhalla’s roof ascends each swelling note,</div>
<div class="verse">And melts away towards Hlidskialf’s tower far in the air remote:</div>
<div class="verse">E’en as the loftiest pine in height exceeds the humblest flower,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus Ervin’s minster is eclips’d by Hlidskialf’s awful tower.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Frey and Freya take their seat: then joins the banquet Tyr,</div>
<div class="verse">Brother of Thor; no danger doth that valiant stripling fear:</div>
<div class="verse">Behind Valfader’s chair he stands, while lasts the sumptuous feast,</div>
<div class="verse">And waits upon him like a page, in scarlet kirtle drest.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But still insensible to joy and mindful of her woes</div>
<div class="verse">Sigh’d beauteous Freya; copious tears bedew’d her cheeks of rose:</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! what is beauty? (thus she thought) and why should it return,</div>
<div class="verse">If from the heart the heart’s beloved remain for ever torn?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">While Freya thus indulged in grief, Odin, the mighty lord,</div>
<div class="verse">His courier Hermod call’d; he came, and, charged with Odin’s word,</div>
<div class="verse">Went out again, but reappear’d, quick as a waterfall,</div>
<div class="verse">And Freya’s daughter, little Hnos, he led into the hall.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The little creature smiling stood behind her mother’s chair,</div>
<div class="verse">Over her shoulders delicate stream’d down her well comb’d hair:</div>
<div class="verse">The mother wept still more; her child close in her arms she prest;</div>
<div class="verse">A flood of golden tears humect the lovely Freya’s breast.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">See Odin now the god sublime quick from the table rise!</div>
<div class="verse">To Hermod whispers he a word with anger in his eyes:<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></div>
<div class="verse">Straight Hermod vanish’d from the hall, arm’d with his magic wand:</div>
<div class="verse">Not half so swift the falcon flies, launch’d by the hunter’s hand.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O that Alfader had not mark’d the beauteous Freya’s grief!</div>
<div class="verse">Alas! how anger’s haste destroys all prospect of relief!</div>
<div class="verse">If Odur could have seen, methinks, his consort fair once more,</div>
<div class="verse">Repentance’ sting he would have felt, and lov’d her, as before.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But now to marble statue changed, what can he feel? ’Tis true,</div>
<div class="verse">His eyes wide open stand, but naught those eyes have power to view:</div>
<div class="verse">No animation from the grapes doth wretched Odur prove</div>
<div class="verse">That deck his brow; on feet he stands, but those feet cannot move.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Freya must for ever grieve, and her own grief impart</div>
<div class="verse">To other hearts; henceforward love was mix’d with painful smart:</div>
<div class="verse">Happy, as handsome, Hnos became, as she advanced in size;</div>
<div class="verse">She brings delight and joy to love; but Freya tears and sighs.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Starkodder mounted on the roof to view each wondrous sight,</div>
<div class="verse">While Hermod friendly show’d the way by evening’s rosy light.</div>
<div class="verse">He mark’d Heidruna the green leaves from th’ ash Yggdrassil crop,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Not far from Valhall’s lofty gate, where Heimdal sentry stood,</div>
<div class="verse">Starkodder the vast bridge of heaven, the gorgeous Bifrost, view’d:</div>
<div class="verse">In its construction precious stones of various hue it blends,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Over this bridge, when they descend to earth, the Asar ride</div>
<div class="verse">To sit as judges in the grove, by th’ ash Yggdrassil’s side:</div>
<div class="verse">This bridge is dangerous to pass, steep, narrow; but, like bees</div>
<div class="verse">Upon a wall, the gods contrive to hold on it with ease.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Southward appears a verdant grove, and there upon a height,</div>
<div class="verse">Resting on azure columns, stands a palace fair and light:</div>
<div class="verse">High beech-trees of the liveliest green encircle this domain:</div>
<div class="verse">There, to Starkodder Heimdal said, doth lovely Freya reign!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Northward appears a forest black; on a steep granite rock</div>
<div class="verse">Stands a strong castle, with deep ditch, which any siege could mock;</div>
<div class="verse">Its roof was tiled with copper shields; Trudvang the name it bore:</div>
<div class="verse">There, Heimdal to Starkodder said, dwells the all-powerful Thor!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>

<div class="verse">The sun now sank beneath the wave, and clear and round the moon</div>
<div class="verse">On Valaskialf, on Folkvang bright, on massive Trudvang shone!</div>
<div class="verse">Athwart the clouds Starkodder saw far off a dazzling light:</div>
<div class="verse">“How now?” to Hermod thus he said, “have ye two moons at night?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The light thou takest for a moon,” thus answered Hermod mild,</div>
<div class="verse">Is Breidablik; that mansion’s roof with costly pearls is tiled:</div>
<div class="verse">There Asa-Balder sits enthron’d the fleecy clouds among;</div>
<div class="verse">Hark! how he chaunts with the white Alfs the dulcet vesper song!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And hark! what thrilling melody the echoing clouds impart!</div>
<div class="verse">Like the soft joys of innocence, it melts the coldest heart:</div>
<div class="verse">But in the hall below resound laughter and boist’rous glee,</div>
<div class="verse">And like the dove before the hawk, the pious tones give way.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To Vingolf now they both descend; there joy tumultuous reigns:</div>
<div class="verse">In honour of Valfader’s name his horn each warrior drains.</div>
<div class="verse">There the good Scalds, who oft the north had gladden’d, touch the chord,</div>
<div class="verse">They all like loving brothers sit at Odin’s oaken board.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A Drapa now, a splendid theme, together they rehearse;</div>
<div class="verse">With glorious choral harmony resounds th’ heroic verse:</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas like to many a bunch of grapes, each from a diff’rent vine</div>
<div class="verse">Gather’d, and now together press’d to form a generous wine.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Here neither jealousy intrigues, nor envy gnaws the heart;</div>
<div class="verse">Each hears with deference sincere when others aught impart,</div>
<div class="verse">And each rejoices like a child who lovely flowers beholds,</div>
<div class="verse">When, what his own hath not conceived, another’s brain unfolds.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There, next to Thor,” thus Hermod said, “Starkodder, is thy seat.”</div>

<div class="verse">It flashes from the shields that hang in rows against the wall;</div>
<div class="verse">The silver hilts and the steel blades a dazzling ray let fall.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When now the mead was drank, and when each Scald had ceased his song,</div>
<div class="verse">Enter’d the scoffer Asa-Lok the jovial guests among;</div>
<div class="verse">His nature is well-known: now red with insolence he grew;</div>
<div class="verse">And to the mock’ry of the gods exposed himself anew.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Though by the greater gods despised and hated by the less,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet often they must needs admire his wit and liveliness;</div>
<div class="verse">At times his cunning was of use worse mischief to prevent,</div>
<div class="verse">And when buffoonery prevail’d, there was his element.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But not innocuous were his jokes; sharp, like the razor’s edge,</div>
<div class="verse">Both friend and foe alike they cut, yet ’twas his privilege.</div>
<div class="verse">When circulates the brimming horn and seriousness gives way,</div>
<div class="verse">We sometimes listen to a fool and tolerate his play.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With Fenris first he play’d, the wolf, whom he in a dark cave</div>
<div class="verse">Of a foul witch begot; but all the guests with aspect grave</div>
<div class="verse">Beheld the sport; it pleased them not, nor did his laughter help;</div>
<div class="verse">For all the Asar fear’d the wolf, though he was but a whelp.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">His eyes glared fiercely; every day his size and strength increas’d:</div>
<div class="verse">Unwilling Odin in his hall suffer’d the hateful beast:</div>
<div class="verse">To Skirnir, messenger of Frey, he turn’d aside his head,</div>
<div class="verse">Whisp’ring a mandate in his ear; Skirnir the hint obey’d.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But now Lok could not fail to see that Fenris was by all</div>
<div class="verse">Abhorr’d and fear’d; without the gate he led him from the hall.</div>
<div class="verse">Loud howl’d the wolf; to earth he hied; he there a robber found,</div>
<div class="verse">And help’d to murder, while his teeth enlarged the victim’s wound.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now to the stable hasten’d Lok by special leave of Thor,</div>
<div class="verse">And brought in one of the white goats that drew the hero’s car:</div>
<div class="verse">The bearded father of the flock was heard to sigh and groan;</div>
<div class="verse">It vex’d the reverend goat to play the part of a buffoon.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With Fulla’s garter at one end Lok by the beard made fast</div>
<div class="verse">The sturdy goat; the other end he tied to his own waist:</div>
<div class="verse">Now to the goat he turn’d his back, and struck him with a thorn;</div>
<div class="verse">The beast enraged ran at his foe full butt with levell’d horn.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To a short distance they retired; now they again fell to;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></div>
<div class="verse">The gods in Valaskialf laugh’d loud the sport absurd to view.</div>
<div class="verse">This amused Lok; no shame he felt within his breast; he thought</div>
<div class="verse">That, while at him they laugh’d, they all were laughing at the goat.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But such buffoonery soon must fail amusement to impart;</div>
<div class="verse">Loud laugh’d the mighty gods, ’tis true, but ’twas not from the heart.</div>
<div class="verse">Oft doth a scene absurd and strange the lungs to laughter move,</div>
<div class="verse">E’en when the heart and sense such scenes must ever disapprove.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Gefion began to frown; now Thor a sign to Bragur made:</div>
<div class="verse">That silly play offended much the chaste high-minded maid.</div>
<div class="verse">She rose to quit the hall, but Thor whisper’d to Bragur: “Pray</div>
<div class="verse">Recite, to soothe the virgin’s ears, some soul-inspiring lay!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Bragur tuned his harp and said: “Now listen to my lays!</div>
<div class="verse">Behold! I strike the golden harp in noble Gefion’s praise!”</div>
<div class="verse">At this the maid resumed her seat; what female could eschew</div>
<div class="verse">To listen gracious to the song, that gives her honour due?</div>

<div class="verse">To cut down all a peasant’s corn that night;</div>

<div class="verse">He threw it high in air, but as it fell,</div>
<div class="verse">The greedy giants had with rancour fell,</div>

<div class="verse">Now Bauge bored the rock, and Odin blew</div>
<div class="verse">Into the hole, but the dust backward flew</div>
<div class="verse">Into his eyes. The giant’s trick was plain;</div>
<div class="verse">The hole was not made straight; but when again</div>

<div class="verse">Strikes after, but in vain he strives the snake to kill.</div>
<div class="verse">And Odin, when he reach’d the other side,</div>
<div class="verse">Resumed his proper form with conscious pride.</div>
<div class="verse">With snow-white arm beneath her cheek of rose,</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Skirnir the open silver portal view’d,</div>
<div class="verse">And through an archway straight his course pursued:</div>
<div class="verse">The passage, cut through coal, and polish’d bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Gave to the traveller sufficient light.</div>
<div class="verse">But soon, when he some paces onward sped,</div>
<div class="verse">Again the starry vault shone o’er his head.</div>
<div class="verse">To a court-yard he came; and there his eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Met with a sight that fill’d him with surprize:</div>
<div class="verse">For there, instead of ducks and hens, a brood</div>
<div class="verse">Of snakes and lizards crawl’d about for food,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></div>
<div class="verse">Which from her apron’s fold a maiden threw,</div>
<div class="verse">And call’d them to be fed in accents strange and new.</div>
<div class="verse">But all at once the maid, when she espied</div>
<div class="verse">The swain, rush’d back behind a porch, and cried</div>
<div class="verse">Stoutly for help: her speech brave Skirnir naught</div>
<div class="verse">Could comprehend; ’twas Finnish, as he thought.</div>
<div class="verse">A numerous train of carles and maidens, scared</div>
<div class="verse">At the shrill sound, slept forth and round them stared.</div>
<div class="verse">Skirnir observ’d them close: their stature short</div>
<div class="verse">And squab: their visage sallow; coarse, lank, swart</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Their hair; small eyes that with no meaning glow;</div>
<div class="verse">Nostrils compress’d; a forehead flat and low;</div>
<div class="verse">Their fingers, like dried carrots, long and lean;</div>
<div class="verse">Awkward their gait; ignoble all their mien:</div>
<div class="verse">Their looks betray, so lustreless, so tame,</div>
<div class="verse">Their portion scant of the celestial flame:</div>
<div class="verse">In Finnmark and in Greenland such a race</div>
<div class="verse">May still be found, devoid of soul or grace.</div>
<div class="verse">“Now help me, Thor!” quoth Skirnir, in despite:</div>
<div class="verse">“Hath my good master lost his senses quite?</div>
<div class="verse">Is then his love a witch like one of these,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose aspect bare the warmest blood would freeze?</div>
<div class="verse">Love’s blind, they say, but madness ’twere, forsooth,</div>
<div class="verse">For such a hero in the bloom of youth</div>
<div class="verse">To pair off with a damsel so uncouth.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus musing towards the porch he cast a glance,</div>
<div class="verse">And there beheld from ’midst her train advance</div>
<div class="verse">The beauteous Gerda: wonder and delight</div>
<div class="verse">Enchant his soul at such a vision bright!</div>
<div class="verse">He stood entranced, and dumb: e’en so doth stand</div>
<div class="verse">The humble swain, when at his lord’s command</div>
<div class="verse">He ploughs the earth, and turning up the mould,</div>
<div class="verse">Discovers fill’d with coins a vase of gold.</div>
<div class="verse">Now could he well conceive his master’s flame,</div>
<div class="verse">For ne’er his eyes beheld a lovelier dame:</div>
<div class="verse">Not golden-hued her locks, like those which deck</div>
<div class="verse">The brow of Freya; down her ivory neck</div>
<div class="verse">Part flow in ebon ringlets, part entwine</div>
<div class="verse">With many a glossy wreath her front divine:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Not heavenly blue her eyes, like those which grace</div>
<div class="verse">The lofty females of the Asar race;</div>
<div class="verse">But like two garnets dark they fervent beam,</div>
<div class="verse">And fix the heart with soul-subduing gleam.</div>
<div class="verse">In just proportion every feature shone,</div>
<div class="verse">And all combin’d to form a paragon.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Skirnir, when the power of speech again</div>
<div class="verse">He felt, address’d the fair, and to explain</div>
<div class="verse">His mission straight began; but with disdain</div>
<div class="verse">Hasty she answer’d: “To thy lord return!</div>
<div class="verse">And tell him, Frey for me may vainly burn.</div>
<div class="verse">Ne’er let him hope to touch my heart, still less</div>
<div class="verse">The mountain damsel in his arms to press:</div>
<div class="verse">I hate him; is he not of Asar race?</div>
<div class="verse">And can we e’er forget the dire disgrace</div>
<div class="verse">Heap’d on us giants? by their mystic spells</div>
<div class="verse">Our Utgard-Lok in gloomiest caverns dwells.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet is his prison vast; we still can boast</div>
<div class="verse">A world more glorious than the one we’ve lost.</div>
<div class="verse">We hold more treasures in our grots profound,</div>
<div class="verse">Than on the surface of the earth are found.</div>
<div class="verse">With ether’s glitt’ring orbs let Odin toy;</div>
<div class="verse">In frothy billows Ægir seek his joy;</div>
<div class="verse">Frigga in fading flow’rets boast her choice;</div>
<div class="verse">The Alfs in unsubstantial air rejoice:</div>
<div class="verse">But we possess fire, metals, precious stones,</div>
<div class="verse">At our command the fierce volcano groans:</div>
<div class="verse">We need but nod, as the proud courser shakes</div>
<div class="verse">His mane, earth with a fev’rish motion quakes:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Walls, castles, towns are levell’d with the ground,</div>
<div class="verse">And forests sink in wat’ry wastes profound.</div>
<div class="verse">Though Odin in Valhalla boast his might,</div>
<div class="verse">Lok hath an elder and superior right,</div>
<div class="verse">And earth still owns him lord: but think! O think!</div>
<div class="verse">The time will come when all your power shall shrink:</div>
<div class="verse">Your race expire; Valhall in flames be hurl’d;</div>
<div class="verse">Though now ye vainly dream to rule the world.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now to fair Gerda answer’d Skirnir mild:</div>
<div class="verse">“Who taught thee such conceits? thou lovely child!</div>
<div class="verse">Not from thy own conception comes thy speech;</div>
<div class="verse">Too innocent thy heart such flights to reach:</div>
<div class="verse">For Utgard-Lok thou knowst not, ne’er hast seen,</div>
<div class="verse">With hair upright like quills and swarthy mien:</div>
<div class="verse">This from thy father thou hast learnt, I ween.</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis well; that thy opinions are the same</div>
<div class="verse">As his, who shall thy filial reverence blame?</div>
<div class="verse">Yet think again! but distantly art thou</div>
<div class="verse">Allied with Utgard-Lok, who reigns below:</div>
<div class="verse">Naught with that chief in common dost thou share;</div>
<div class="verse">He, frightful to behold; thou, wondrous fair.</div>
<div class="verse">Like rose-bud thou, t’embalm the air design’d;</div>
<div class="verse">Like deadly nightshade he, to blast mankind.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet oft the virtues of a child suffice</div>
<div class="verse">To expiate her father’s crimes and vice:</div>
<div class="verse">From unlike sources various products spring;</div>
<div class="verse">Joy sometimes grief; misfortune bliss doth bring.</div>
<div class="verse">Between the sand runs not the muddy stream</div>
<div class="verse">So long, till purified it shows a gleam</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Like that of diamond? in its surface bright</div>
<div class="verse">The maidens then to view their forms delight.</div>
<div class="verse">From mould impure sweet flowers their birth derive,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet lift their heads in air, and fragrant thrive.</div>
<div class="verse">Now let the rose of love thy front entwine,</div>
<div class="verse">And with earth’s brightest jewel heaven combine!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Gerda thus replied in soften’d tone:</div>
<div class="verse">“Thy speech is courteous and discreet, I own:</div>
<div class="verse">With zeal and eloquence dost thou fulfill</div>
<div class="verse">The task imposed thee by thy sov’reign’s will:</div>
<div class="verse">So now depart! but first, I pray thee, taste,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy strength to renovate, our night’s repast,</div>
<div class="verse">Then quick returning to thy bright domain</div>
<div class="verse">Inform thy anxious lord, his suit is vain.</div>
<div class="verse">Tell him, however prudent, smooth and kind</div>
<div class="verse">Thy words, they naught have influenc’d Gerda’s mind.</div>
<div class="verse">Stout champions, brave in war, our mountains yield,</div>
<div class="verse">Chiefs, whom in power the Asar ne’er excell’d:</div>
<div class="verse">Should such a chief one day his passion prove</div>
<div class="verse">For me, and bend my heart to mutual love,</div>
<div class="verse">Then will the mountain nymph with joy and pride</div>
<div class="verse">Accept his hand, and hail the name of bride.</div>
<div class="verse">Here in my native vales content I live;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></div>
<div class="verse">’Midst mountains high, and fountains clear I thrive.</div>
<div class="verse">A princess too by birth, born to command,</div>
<div class="verse">Among the giant race pre-eminent I stand.</div>
<div class="verse">And, trust me! not so humble or so low</div>
<div class="verse">Doth Gerda feel, as with submissive brow</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
<div class="verse">T’intrude herself amongst the gods on high;</div>
<div class="verse">To meet contempt from every Disa’s eye,</div>
<div class="verse">Who hold my birth too mean, myself too base</div>
<div class="verse">To form alliance with the Asar race.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Therein thou dost the fair Asynior wrong;</div>
<div class="verse">(Thus Skirnir answer’d with persuasive tongue)</div>
<div class="verse">Pride, arrogance prevail amongst mankind,</div>
<div class="verse">But in a Disa’s soul ne’er harbour find.</div>
<div class="verse">The features grand that mark the gods on high</div>
<div class="verse">Are virtue, wisdom, and simplicity,</div>
<div class="verse">Not birth; since ’tis well known the gods among,</div>
<div class="verse">That Thor and Odin both from nothing sprung,</div>
<div class="verse">Like insects, at Alfader’s nod; though now</div>
<div class="verse">On Valhall’s throne they sit with radiant brow.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To him replied the lively Gerda: “Love,</div>
<div class="verse">For what we know not, we can never prove.</div>
<div class="verse">I know my native vale, each rock, each field,</div>
<div class="verse">But Frey or Valhall ne’er my eyes beheld.</div>
<div class="verse">Me hath he never seen; whence springs his flame</div>
<div class="verse">At once so ardent for the mountain dame?</div>
<div class="verse">Methinks, to tell thee truth, my gentle swain!</div>
<div class="verse">All goes not right in thy fond master’s brain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And now his master’s actions and his fate</div>
<div class="verse">Did Skirnir circumstantially relate:</div>
<div class="verse">How he ascended Hlidskialf’s lofty tower,</div>
<div class="verse">And what from thence he view’d in Gerda’s bower:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
<div class="verse">How, when her charms she bared, love’s potent dart</div>
<div class="verse">At once transfix’d his vacillating heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With downcast look and palpitating breast,</div>
<div class="verse">Deep blushing, Gerda listen’d to her guest.</div>
<div class="verse">But when young Skirnir talk’d about the moon,</div>
<div class="verse">She laughed, and quick resumed her jesting tone.</div>
<div class="verse">“If like the moon thy master be,” she said,</div>
<div class="verse">“Let him ne’er hope to win a youthful maid!</div>
<div class="verse">For pale and sallow is the moon; such hue</div>
<div class="verse">All blooming damsels with repugnance view:</div>
<div class="verse">Such love is lukewarm.”&mdash;“Nay!” the swain replied,</div>
<div class="verse">“Did Frey once press thee in his arms as bride,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou wouldst not of his lukewarm love complain;</div>
<div class="verse">But since my powers of argument are vain,</div>
<div class="verse">’Twere best I seek my couch; but first, I pray,</div>
<div class="verse">Let me the bower, where thou dost sleep, survey.</div>
<div class="verse">A present from my sov’reign lord I bear</div>
<div class="verse">For thee, which I would fain deposit there.”</div>
<div class="verse">Laughing, she pointed out her chamber-door,</div>
<div class="verse">Then went herself his supper to procure;</div>
<div class="verse">For Gerda was by nature good and kind,</div>
<div class="verse">And Skirnir’s jovial frankness pleased her mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Skirnir now stood alone; her couch he view’d,</div>
<div class="verse">Near which a vase of alabaster stood,</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein the maid, before she went to rest,</div>
<div class="verse">Was wont to lave her face, her arms, her breast:</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas fill’d with water: with his project pleas’d,</div>
<div class="verse">In haste his horn the gallant Skirnir seiz’d;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Within the vase all its contents he pour’d.</div>
<div class="verse">And charged it with the image of his lord.</div>
<div class="verse">This done, he left the bower of Gerda strait,</div>
<div class="verse">And his own chamber sought with mind elate.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But now the mountain damsel, when her guest</div>
<div class="verse">And all her menials had retired to rest,</div>
<div class="verse">Flew to her chamber, curious to behold</div>
<div class="verse">The gift from Valhall brought by Skirnir bold.</div>
<div class="verse">Curling her lip, as maids are wont to do,</div>
<div class="verse">She thus exclaim’d with laugh contemptuous: “Now</div>
<div class="verse">I needs must view the wond’rous present given</div>
<div class="verse">By the enamour’d denizen of heaven.</div>
<div class="verse">What can it be? diamonds, or rubies bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Silver, or gold are common in my sight:</div>
<div class="verse">Such treasures in our spacious grots abound,</div>
<div class="verse">But in the skies, I trow, are seldom found.”</div>
<div class="verse">But when around she look’d, and naught could find,</div>
<div class="verse">She laughed again, but anger vex’d her mind:</div>
<div class="verse">“I thought as much; a miserable joke;</div>
<div class="verse">Worthy of Asar;” jeering thus she spoke.</div>
<div class="verse">“I must allow, the gods do far surpass</div>
<div class="verse">In fraud and mockery our giant race.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And now the maid began to loose her zone,</div>
<div class="verse">And from her shoulders doff the woollen gown:</div>
<div class="verse">Bared to the middle by the diamond’s light</div>
<div class="verse">She stands; what glorious charms appear in sight!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
<div class="verse">In th’ hollow of her hand she caught the wave</div>
<div class="verse">To cool her purple cheek, her front to lave;</div>
<div class="verse">But when she view’d the image bright of Frey</div>
<div class="verse">Reflected in the wave, a piercing cry</div>
<div class="verse">She gave, and started back with fear assail’d;</div>
<div class="verse">Then blushing, cross-ways o’er her bosom held</div>
<div class="verse">Her arms, and catching up her robe in haste,</div>
<div class="verse">Around her beauteous body wound it fast.</div>
<div class="verse">But soon to admiration changed her fear,</div>
<div class="verse">And to her mind the stratagem was clear.</div>
<div class="verse">Wrapp’d in her garment to the neck, she flew</div>
<div class="verse">Once more the image beautiful to view:</div>
<div class="verse">The form divine of the enchanting god</div>
<div class="verse">Melted the maiden’s heart, and fired her blood:</div>
<div class="verse">What majesty displays his forehead high!</div>
<div class="verse">What tender mournful smiles beam from his eye</div>
<div class="verse">Of fire! his bosom seems t’exhale a sigh:</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas meant for Gerda; from his polish’d brow</div>
<div class="verse">Adown his ivory neck the golden tresses flow:</div>
<div class="verse">With hand placed on his heart he seems to say;</div>
<div class="verse">“Here Gerda reigns with undisputed sway!”</div>
<div class="verse">Pensive awhile she stood; nor was aware</div>
<div class="verse">That down her damask cheek had roll’d a tear</div>
<div class="verse">Into her lover’s mouth: an ardent flame,</div>
<div class="verse">O wonder! from the gelid water came,</div>
<div class="verse">And enter’d deep her heart: now with a sigh,</div>
<div class="verse">O’er the vase leaning, she exclaim’d: “O Frey!”</div>
<div class="verse">Then sudden started back once more, afraid,</div>
<div class="verse">Some prying witness might her bower invade:</div>
<div class="verse">But when secure that she alone was there,</div>
<div class="verse">She oft bow’d down to kiss the image fair.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
<div class="verse">It vanish’d now within the eddying wave,</div>
<div class="verse">Which had the power thy purple mouth to lave,</div>
<div class="verse">But not to cool thy lips, O virgin bright!</div>
<div class="verse">But when the water clear again in sight</div>
<div class="verse">Brought back the image of the god beloved,</div>
<div class="verse">Reflection deep the heart of Gerda moved.</div>

<div class="verse">Perfect was Frey; without one flaw or stain</div>
<div class="verse">His form; a god, a prince amongst the Asar train.</div>

<div class="verse">Soft as a dove, and gentle as a lamb:</div>
<div class="verse">Now slides her ’kerchief from her ivory neck;</div>
<div class="verse">The air was warm; no fears her passion check.</div>

<div class="verse">To look into the basin standing nigh,</div>
<div class="verse">And contemplate the much-lov’d form of Frey.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At length the gentle Siofna, who unseen</div>
<div class="verse">’Midst Gerda’s train had enter’d, and the scene</div>

<div class="verse">And waved her poppy garland o’er her head:</div>
<div class="verse">She closed her eyelids with her magic art.</div>
<div class="verse">And sent delightful dreams to gladden Gerda’s heart.</div>

<div class="verse">“What thou hast said is true enough:</div>
<div class="verse">The hammer, when by strength or skill</div>
<div class="verse">Unexercised, is useless still.</div>
<div class="verse">But first allow me to demand,</div>
<div class="verse">What means that fetter in thy hand?</div>

<div class="verse">O rueful act! what boots, my friend,</div>
<div class="verse">Courage by reason unrestrain’d?</div>
<div class="verse">Lost is thy hammer in the wave,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus said, As-Odin slowly rose;</div>

<div class="verse">Down on the earth all night he threw</div>

<div class="verse">Down to their very roots consum’d.</div>
<div class="verse">The children scream’d; the mothers tore</div>
<div class="verse">Their hair; Thor foam’d like angry boar:</div>
<div class="verse">And he, who whilom lov’d to save,</div>
<div class="verse">Prov’d unrelenting as the grave.</div>
<div class="verse">But when at length shone forth the day,</div>

<div class="verse">There Sif receiv’d him in her arms,</div>

<div class="verse">And thunders shake Heimkringlas with soul-appalling peals,</div>
<div class="verse">I share Hlorrida’s glory: each time earth trembling shook,</div>
<div class="verse">I thought myself his equal, and frown’d with swagg’ring look.</div>
<div class="verse">Each Disa smiled enchanting, when courteous I address’d her;</div>
<div class="verse">With blushes Fulla trembled, when in my arms I press’d her.</div>
<div class="verse">She is in love with Lok, I know, poor little innocent thing!</div>
<div class="verse">And many other Disar in my net I hoped to bring.</div>
<div class="verse">My impudence doth in their cheek the blush of shame recall,</div>
<div class="verse">But soon, becoming used to it, they’ll cease to blush at all.</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet to my taste Sâhrimner was, and sweeter still the mead;</div>
<div class="verse">And when the proud Einherier pranced about the flow’ry mead</div>
<div class="verse">With shield and lance, I was content: all things to hear and see,</div>
<div class="verse">And mock at all the gods by turns, was charming sport to me.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
<div class="verse">I was the clev’rest of them all, and with the gods I play’d,</div>
<div class="verse">Just as a cat does with a mouse, which he has just waylaid.</div>
<div class="verse">First doth he his poor captive with feign’d caresses quail;</div>
<div class="verse">His eyes with malice sparkle; he frisks about his tail:</div>
<div class="verse">At length when weary of the sport his food Grimalkin needs,</div>
<div class="verse">His teeth inflict the mortal crunch, and then poor mousie bleeds!</div>
<div class="verse">But now Puss on the house-roof sits, nor deems himself secure</div>
<div class="verse">E’en there; he licks his beard and paws; his master from the door</div>
<div class="verse">Hath chased him in his anger, because i’ th’ cupboard he</div>
<div class="verse">With his dame’s hams and bacon had chosen to make free.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But if their loss I feel, will not they feel my loss much more?</div>
<div class="verse">Odin, I’m sure, when no one laughs, will feel vexation sore.</div>
<div class="verse">Long days of constant seriousness the Asar soon will rue;</div>
<div class="verse">They’ll find that to the zest of life mirth must contribute too.</div>
<div class="verse">Heavy and dull are they become already; there they sit,</div>
<div class="verse">And yawn, and in their mead-horn gaze, when they have emptied it.</div>
<div class="verse">Let but the Disar once the bread without the leaven taste,</div>
<div class="verse">Insipid will it prove, I trow, without friend Loptur’s yeast:</div>
<div class="verse">Without the poignancy of change pleasure itself must pall,</div>
<div class="verse">And light, unchequer’d e’er by shade, be insupportable.</div>
<div class="verse">No diff’rence of opinion now excites ye; true, ye breathe,</div>
<div class="verse">But spiritless and dull your life; ’tis the repose of death.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In such reflections Loptur from sorrow sought relief,</div>
<div class="verse">And often gazed he wistful upon Yggdrassil’s leaf.</div>
<div class="verse">“Could I,” thought he, “of Asa-Thor the pardon once obtain,</div>
<div class="verse">The favour of the other gods ’twere easy to regain.”</div>
<div class="verse">Thus Lok amidst the grove of pines pensive and restless stray’d;</div>
<div class="verse">His silence deep at length he broke: “I have it now,” he said;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
<div class="verse">For Thor his hammer I’ll procure; I think, upon my life,</div>
<div class="verse">To get his hammer back again he’d give away his wife.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now over hill and dale he flew, quite joyous at the thought,</div>
<div class="verse">And passing through the hard-wood grove, soon reach’d the mountain grot:</div>
<div class="verse">There at the entrance of a cave sat Thrymur, giant-king,</div>
<div class="verse">Around a bunch of arrows sharp twining a golden string:</div>
<div class="verse">Red ribbands in his courser’s mane then did he interlace,</div>
<div class="verse">While the full moon pour’d streams of light adown his dusky face.</div>
<div class="verse">Into the field the giant look’d, and seeing Lok, cried out:</div>
<div class="verse">“Ha! welcome here! thou smallest toe in mighty Odin’s foot!</div>
<div class="verse">To visit us poor folks below doth Loptur condescend?</div>
<div class="verse">What pleasure can an Asa find in our dark goblin-land?</div>
<div class="verse">Have the gods turn’d thee out of doors? hast thou been indiscreet?</div>
<div class="verse">Shame were it such a chief of worth so scornfully to treat;</div>
<div class="verse">To start them game the gods, perhaps, thee falcon-like have sent:</div>
<div class="verse">Speak out then, thou accomplish’d rogue! say! what is thy intent?”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now sitting down by Thrymur’s side with mien composed he said:</div>
<div class="verse">“With insults deep and injury the gods have Lok repaid;</div>
<div class="verse">Did I not hope one day your cause to aid, ye giants good!</div>
<div class="verse">I ne’er would set my foot again in Valhall’s curst abode.</div>
<div class="verse">You do require a spy, methinks, to find out and detect</div>
<div class="verse">All that the fraudful Asar brood against your realm project:</div>
<div class="verse">Some clever and ingenious wight; and where on earth’s vast round</div>
<div class="verse">More proper for this task than Lok can any one be found?</div>
<div class="verse">Besides, unknown to ye no doubt, I’ve often proved your friend,</div>
<div class="verse">And to some gratitude from ye I may with right pretend:</div>
<div class="verse">But howsoe’er with pitying eye my sufferings ye regard,</div>
<div class="verse">In my own conscience, in my heart I find my best reward.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Thrymur answer’d, laughing loud: “What means this canting speech?”</div>
<div class="verse">With pious look and honied words thinkst thou to overreach</div>
<div class="verse">Us giant champions, as ye catch the larks with berries red</div>
<div class="verse">Behind a net of horse-hair fix’d, and ’bout the meadow spread?</div>
<div class="verse">Tears canst thou shed, like Dragon foul, when, eager for his food,</div>
<div class="verse">He seeketh travelers to entrap within the marshy flood;</div>
<div class="verse">But out with it! thy errand quick, O turncoat vile, relate!</div>
<div class="verse">Be frank for once, or in thy face, by Hel, I’ll shut my gate.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah! thou hast reason to be proud and haughty,” answer’d Lok:</div>
<div class="verse">“Now may’st thou with contempt on Thor, and all Valhalla look:</div>
<div class="verse">Hast thou not found his hammer ’twixt the scales of Jormundgard?</div>
<div class="verse">A glorious booty ’tis, forsooth: ’twill all your pains reward:</div>
<div class="verse">For though that hammer’s use thyself thou dost not understand,</div>
<div class="verse">Immense advantage ’twill afford; thou may’st with right demand,</div>
<div class="verse">In ransom for that weapon, all the wealth thou canst conceive;</div>
<div class="verse">Whate’er thou chusest to exact, the god will freely give.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What ransom?” cried the giant harsh and rough: “doth Thor possess</div>
<div class="verse">Gold, silver, copper, as I do within my deep recess?</div>
<div class="verse">Such gifts small value have for me; for riches naught I care;</div>
<div class="verse">But much of Freya have I heard, and of her beauty rare:</div>
<div class="verse">They say, she doth in form and grace all other dames eclipse;</div>
<div class="verse">Ivory her limbs, of gold her hair, of coral are her lips:</div>
<div class="verse">Her voice sweet music; plump well-rounded arms; a laughing mien;</div>
<div class="verse">A mouth that is for kissing made, and loves it too, I ween.</div>
<div class="verse">I burn with ardour to embrace a nymph of colour white;</div>
<div class="verse">No more the dames of swarthy hue my passion can excite.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
<div class="verse">If therefore Freya fair, as bride, Odin to me will give,</div>
<div class="verse">Thor in exchange his hammer bright that instant shall receive.</div>
<div class="verse">Did not Frey wed a Jotun nymph? If so, with equal right</div>
<div class="verse">May Jotun Thrymur claim as spouse his sister Freya bright.</div>
<div class="verse">Such my proposal is, which thou to Asagard mayst bear;</div>
<div class="verse">Why should we plague each other’s lives with endless hale and war,</div>
<div class="verse">Let friendship durable ensue upon this marriage tie!</div>
<div class="verse">But mark me! Miölner eight miles deep doth in the ocean lie:</div>
<div class="verse">Never again shall Thor, I swear, his much-prized arm behold,</div>
<div class="verse">Unless I clasp in my embrace Freya with hair of gold.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus spake the giant-king: a dwarf, as page, came to the gate,</div>
<div class="verse">And oped it; in his master went; the dwarf then closed it strait.</div>
<div class="verse">Lok stood without at th’ midnight hour abandon’d and forlorn,</div>
<div class="verse">To Asar and to giants both the object of their scorn.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He laugh’d out loudly in the dark: so fearful was the sound,</div>
<div class="verse">The owls perch’d on the forest trees fell down upon the ground.</div>
<div class="verse">To learn the cause, the scolding Ran rose from the depths of ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">And scars on warriors’ limbs now bled afresh at th’ wild commotion:</div>
<div class="verse">Fell Jormundgardur shook himself; for miles and miles around</div>
<div class="verse">Men, fields,and dwellings were submerged in ocean’s waves profound.</div>
<div class="verse">Each Nidding starting from his couch by stings of conscience vex’d</div>
<div class="verse">Arose; a cold sweat on his brow announced a soul perplex’d:</div>
<div class="verse">Fenris loud howling through the sky the vast creation scared;</div>
<div class="verse">Lok’s laughter and the wolfish howl the long long night were heard.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Giants and gods alike I hate,” said Lok: “soon shall they prove,</div>
<div class="verse">How terrible that power can be, which but itself doth love.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Would I could make them perish all together! ha! what bliss,</div>
<div class="verse">Could I the vast Heimkringlas sink i’ th’ bottomless abyss!</div>
<div class="verse">Ye’ve exiled me from Valaskialf; asylum ye refuse;</div>
<div class="verse">But means of vengeance still I hold, and such I mean to use.</div>
<div class="verse">Like tree rubbing ’gainst tree in fell collision shall ye come,</div>
<div class="verse">Until a flame arise, and all your hated brood consume:</div>
<div class="verse">Then shall ye when too late, I trow, do honour to my skill:”</div>
<div class="verse">Thus did the traitor Lok the air with groans and curses fill.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“With force unmanageable works the purblind mountain race;</div>
<div class="verse">The Asar boast their virtue pure, combined with strength and grace:</div>
<div class="verse">If to an act of treachery I once could Thor incline,</div>
<div class="verse">Then cunning overreaches strength; the triumph then were mine;</div>
<div class="verse">Thor a mere giant then becomes: when at the midnight hour</div>
<div class="verse">Odin of witches dire invokes the soul-appalling power,</div>
<div class="verse">Yggdrassil trembles; then grows dry the fount in Urda’s vale:</div>
<div class="verse">Then shines the frightful Jormungard with doubly brilliant scale:</div>
<div class="verse">Hel’s colour from a livid blue changes from joy to white,</div>
<div class="verse">And Heimdal’s horn excites the world to sempiternal fight.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But since his last expulsion Lok to mount to Valhall’s dome</div>
<div class="verse">Without safe conduct ventured not, and houseless still must roam:</div>
<div class="verse">Towards evening he reach’d the grove of beech on Sealand’s isle,</div>
<div class="verse">As homeward with his plough return’d the peasant from his toil.</div>
<div class="verse">There is a spot within that grove, whence fountains with delight</div>
<div class="verse">Spring from benignant Hertha’s breast, and through the sand stream bright:</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas on the spot where Leire stood, and afterwards king Hro<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></div>
<div class="verse">With many a stone and plank and joist constructed Kongebo.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></div>
<div class="verse">At morning and at evening’s blush there loved the Alfs to rove,</div>
<div class="verse">And scatter Freya’s tears like dew throughout the beechen grove:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And when she prick’d her finger with her needle, up they took</div>
<div class="verse">The drops of blood, and pour’d them on the green plants by the brook:</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! by the next revolving sun those plants with flowers were crown’d,</div>
<div class="verse">Which spread delightful odours through the grove for miles around.</div>
<div class="verse">They took the yellow sparrows grey, who o’er earth’s surface rove,</div>
<div class="verse">And kiss’d their beaks and taught them how to pour forth notes of love.</div>
<div class="verse">Nightingales they became at once, whose tones so sweetly sound,</div>
<div class="verse">And fill each youthful heart with dreams of tenderness profound.</div>
<div class="verse">Now ev’ry morning they anoint the locks of Freya fair</div>
<div class="verse">With precious unguent, which embalms with fragrancy the air.</div>
<div class="verse">Once from the Disa in a shell they stole some drops of oil,</div>
<div class="verse">And pour’d them on a weed; a Julian flower repaid their toil:</div>
<div class="verse">But far too strong that odour proved; its strength prevails e’en now.</div>
<div class="verse">Some drops were left; with water mix’d upon the turf they throw</div>
<div class="verse">Those drops, and lo! upon green stems blue violets fragrant grow!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus in that grove the little Alfs amuse themselves secure;</div>
<div class="verse">They teach the peasant’s cock to crow loud at his master’s door,</div>
<div class="verse">To rouse him from his slumber, and make him hie with speed</div>
<div class="verse">To earn with plough and harrow for wife and children bread.</div>
<div class="verse">At night they show the lover, who through the forest roves,</div>
<div class="verse">The way that he should wander, to find the maid he loves:</div>
<div class="verse">And when he meets her, when her hand he presses tenderly,</div>
<div class="verse">The Alfs their hands together bind with links of flowers, which she,</div>
<div class="verse">Now kind become, ne’er seeks to loose.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent15">But while the blithesome crew</div>
<div class="verse">Of Alfs were dancing on the grass yet glitt’ring bright with dew,</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! from an ash-tree’s hollow trunk Lok started forth to view!</div>
<div class="verse">The Erl-king in the full-moon’s glare he much resembled now,</div>
<div class="verse">With crown of blackberry, thick beard, and tail like that of cow.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
<div class="verse">At first the Alfs were terrified; away they fain would fly;</div>
<div class="verse">They fear’d it was their enemies the black Alfs hov’ring nigh:</div>
<div class="verse">But when they Loptur recognized, they hail’d him with a shout</div>
<div class="verse">Of laughter, and delighted frisk’d their new-come guest about:</div>
<div class="verse">He pleased them; in their frolics oft he took an active part;</div>
<div class="verse">He was an Asa, well they knew, but knew not his bad heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“How now? friend Lok! what dost thou here i th’ forest? art thou sprung</div>
<div class="verse">From th’ branches of the tree, to dance our mirthful choir among?”</div>
<div class="verse">“Yes! my dear little creatures! Lok, ye know, doth love ye all;</div>
<div class="verse">Eager to teach ye novel sports, he comes to join your ball.”</div>
<div class="verse">He join’d the dance; a circle now the Alfs around him trace,</div>
<div class="verse">But Lok’s tail made a rustling noise, like serpent in the grass:</div>
<div class="verse">Sudden the fountain ceased to flow; the once transparent brook</div>
<div class="verse">Troubled and dark became, while toads in stagnant marshes croak;</div>
<div class="verse">A swarm of crickets hover round a corpse with deaf’ning cry:</div>
<div class="verse">But how could innocent white Alfs suspect Lok’s treachery?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thus on the grass in Autumn late two lovers often sit;</div>
<div class="verse">They gaze upon each other’s face with rapture and delight;</div>
<div class="verse">They feel not that the fev’rish air announces: “One shall die!”</div>
<div class="verse">Grasping their flow’ry garland in their hands, their ecstacy</div>
<div class="verse">Makes them incautious; they inhale the pestilential breath</div>
<div class="verse">Of the foul Lok, who lurks behind the bushes on the heath.</div>
<div class="verse">The placid moon, which cheer’d so oft their love with radiance meek,</div>
<div class="verse">But which had not the power to cool the deep blush on their cheek,</div>
<div class="verse">A few weeks later on the bier a lifeless corpse doth view</div>
<div class="verse">Crown’d with white flowers: from Lok’s black art such bitter fruits ensue!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ye friendly little Alfs!” said Lok in soft cajoling strain,</div>
<div class="verse">“D’ye wish to know the reason why I join your sportive train?</div>
<div class="verse">Ye’re call’d Valhalla’s children; the Asar hold ye dear;</div>
<div class="verse">Poor Lok needs your assistance, and therefore comes he here.</div>
<div class="verse">I have been sadly indiscreet; too free hath been my tongue;</div>
<div class="verse">But Ægir’s banquet is to blame; his liquor was too strong,</div>
<div class="verse">My head too weak: I’ve mock’d the gods; my crime I frankly own:</div>
<div class="verse">But if great Odin will once more admit me near his throne,</div>
<div class="verse">If Thor for what I’ve said or sung will grant his pardon too,</div>
<div class="verse">I promise in return (my word is truth itself, ye know)</div>
<div class="verse">To fetch him Miölner back again, which deep in earth now lies;</div>
<div class="verse">So that again he may strike home, and win each glorious prize,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor fear that a short hammer-shaft his strength might neutralize.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The friendly Alfer promised all for Lok to intercede:</div>
<div class="verse">Like doves so white to Valhall’s dome they flew his cause to plead:</div>
<div class="verse">With folded hands in lengthen’d file entering, they knelt before</div>
<div class="verse">The Asar, for the culprit Lok forgiveness to implore.</div>
<div class="verse">All hearts were moved; first Freya smiled; then Frey: ah! who can say</div>
<div class="verse">“No,” to a prayer for mercy, when such lovely children pray?</div>
<div class="verse">Now they led forth the criminal, who soft behind them crept,</div>
<div class="verse">He flatter’d, play’d the hypocrite, fell on his knees, and wept;</div>
<div class="verse">He tried to kiss Thor’s garment: at this demeanour base</div>
<div class="verse">The hero blush’d with anger, and struck him on the face.</div>
<div class="verse">“Avaunt! thou miserable wretch!” said Thor, with fearful cry;</div>
<div class="verse">“Thy abjectness more wrath excites, than did thy treachery.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dear shalt thou pay for this,” thought Lok, “thy pride one day be cool’d;</div>
<div class="verse">The bowstring’s pulled so frequently, it snaps at length: but hold.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<div class="verse">I must refrain from menace, be meek and humble here,</div>
<div class="verse">And all my schemes of vengeance till fitter time defer.”</div>
<div class="verse">So now in haste up springing, he loudly shouted! “Peace;</div>
<div class="verse">Good tidings now I bring ye: all strife and hate shall cease:</div>
<div class="verse">Giants and gods no longer eternal war shall wage;</div>
<div class="verse">The bosom melts with kindness, that once throbb’d high with rage.</div>
<div class="verse">The heart of Thrymur beats with love; the object of his flame</div>
<div class="verse">Is Freya; to the rocks and woods he sighs out Freya’s name.</div>
<div class="verse">And when athwart the birch-trees he views her glorious fane,</div>
<div class="verse">And marks her spindle sparkling with many a yellow skein,</div>
<div class="verse">The female, thinks the giant, who such a quantity</div>
<div class="verse">Of flax can spin, must truly a clever housewife be.</div>
<div class="verse">She’s just the dame for Thrymur’s taste; soft, delicate, and thin</div>
<div class="verse">Must be the fingers, that can draw the silken thread so fine.</div>
<div class="verse">Her skin the lily’s hue presents, her cheek the peach’s bloom,</div>
<div class="verse">Her lips are red as blood, I’m told; the rest all white as foam:</div>
<div class="verse">With brightest gold in colour her silken tresses vie,</div>
<div class="verse">And three times can she wind them around her forehead high.</div>
<div class="verse">They say she’s in affliction, her husband she has lost;</div>
<div class="verse">Good sense this doth not argue to be so deeply crost:</div>
<div class="verse">But it denotes fidelity; and that, one may surmise,</div>
<div class="verse">Supposes that she too upon fidelity relies:</div>
<div class="verse">For ah! where would the guerdon be of virtue, if one doubted</div>
<div class="verse">Incessantly? for Freya too, whose beauty is undoubted.</div>
<div class="verse">The thistle no attention meets, e’en from the butterfly;</div>
<div class="verse">But the rose ne’er can rest in peace for th’ homage of the bee.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Thy sermon on fidelity, I pray thee, spare us now!”</div>
<div class="verse">Said Freya, laughing: “emblem of fidelity, we know,</div>
<div class="verse">Is Loptur’s heart: but quickly Thrymur’s demand prefer,</div>
<div class="verse">And thy remarks on virtue another time we’ll hear.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“They are not mine, fair lady!” quoth Lok: “I only come,</div>
<div class="verse">As messenger from Thrymur, to Valhall’s azure dome.</div>
<div class="verse">Freya the Disa fair he loves with manhood’s fervent fire;</div>
<div class="verse">His love for her all Jotunheim with softness doth inspire.</div>
<div class="verse">His father, Lok of Utgard stern, so wrapp’d up in his son,</div>
<div class="verse">Hath for the ardent lover’s vows a tender pity shown.</div>
<div class="verse">Brother-in-law of Odin thus should Utgard-Lok become,</div>
<div class="verse">A mighty change will then forthwith o’er all Heimkringlas come:</div>
<div class="verse">Henceforth twixt good and evil no diff’rence will appear;</div>
<div class="verse">All contrasts blend harmonious, when the dark owl shall pair</div>
<div class="verse">With the white dove: sunshine shall mix with the volcano’s gleam</div>
<div class="verse">And in Valhalla’s fragrant grove unsavoury vapours steam:</div>
<div class="verse">Smooth-skinn’d and beardless man become; woman a beard shall wear;</div>
<div class="verse">Twilight will all the fashion be; day and night disappear:</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet violets on carrion bloom; a blade of straw a knife,</div>
<div class="verse">A spit a lily straight become: the warrior and his wife</div>
<div class="verse">Will change professions; she the javelin, he the distaff hold:</div>
<div class="verse">Such transformations wonderful our eyes will then behold.</div>
<div class="verse">But Thrymur is a serious wight, this must not be forgot,</div>
<div class="verse">He’s somewhat jealous too, and jokes he understandeth not:</div>
<div class="verse">And Freya must, if she consent to share the giant’s reign,</div>
<div class="verse">As Thrymur’s spouse, in subterranean gloom for aye remain.</div>
<div class="verse">True, love will vanish from the earth; but where, I pray, the loss,</div>
<div class="verse">Since hate no longer will exist our hearts to plague and cross?</div>
<div class="verse">Heimdaller’s Bifrost then will lose its variegated hue,</div>
<div class="verse">No more display its gorgeous rays, red, yellow, green, and blue:</div>
<div class="verse">Those colours will together blend, and form a dingy grey;</div>
<div class="verse">And toads within their moss-grown pools will sing like thrushes gay.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At this proposal Freya’s breast with indignation swell’d,</div>
<div class="verse">And thus with words of bitter scorn Lok’s project she repell’d:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
<div class="verse">“Were Freya to the giant’s land disposed to go with thee,</div>
<div class="verse">Must Freya terribly, forsooth, in want of husband be.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But now the Asar, when the sun its earliest rays display’d,</div>
<div class="verse">Assemble all to hold the Ting beneath Yggdrassil’s shade.</div>
<div class="verse">There, to avoid temptation, they did not Lok invite:</div>
<div class="verse">But Lok to visit Heimdal went towards the rainbow bright:</div>
<div class="verse">Soft in his ear he whisper’d, gave counsel, swore that zeal</div>
<div class="verse">For Valhall had induced him that mission to fulfil:</div>
<div class="verse">“The gods,” said he, “I know, ’gainst me a strong aversion have,</div>
<div class="verse">But the whole thing, as thou perceiv’st, is of importance grave.</div>
<div class="verse">Thee judgment lacks not; my advice thou’st heard me frankly state;</div>
<div class="verse">Follow it, if it seem thee good: if not, reject it strait!</div>
<div class="verse">But whatsoever be resolv’d, let it be quickly done,</div>
<div class="verse">For execution the design should follow hard upon.</div>
<div class="verse">Heimdaller who had heard what past ’tween Lok and Thrymur grim</div>
<div class="verse">At th’ entrance of the grot, and knew, Lok did not lie this time,</div>
<div class="verse">Approved of the proposal, and took the counsel well:</div>
<div class="verse">The worm thus often pierceth the nut with hardest shell.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then Asa-Heimdal at the Ting thus spake aloud: “’Tis time</div>
<div class="verse">The giants’ pride to tame, methinks, and vanquish Jotunheim.</div>
<div class="verse">To raise them to the rank of gods, that oft we’ve done; thereby</div>
<div class="verse">Our strength we lost not: doth not Niord fierce Skada mollify?</div>
<div class="verse">And Ægir with his potent arm check Rana’s perfidy?</div>
<div class="verse">Young Gerda dotes upon her spouse; she’s full of charm and grace;</div>
<div class="verse">She gave Skidbladner to the gods; she’s of a better race:</div>
<div class="verse">Women with coal-black hair from her descend, within whose blood</div>
<div class="verse">The flame of love more ardent glows. Say! were not Lok a god,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
<div class="verse">What mischief might he not effect in regions void of light?</div>
<div class="verse">And hath not oft the moon bestow’d the power of day on night?</div>
<div class="verse">But should light’s ray, deserting heaven, descend into th’ abyss,</div>
<div class="verse">Would not for ever disappear our glory, strength, and bliss?</div>
<div class="verse">Shall we then Freya cede? ah no! by the great gods, I swear,</div>
<div class="verse">Valhall a joyless waste would prove, if Freya were not there.</div>
<div class="verse">Iduna’s fruit of health and youth accords, ’tis true, the power,</div>
<div class="verse">But Freya ’tis who sows the seed of love’s delightful flower:</div>
<div class="verse">We all admire her; when the gods she folds in her embrace,</div>
<div class="verse">The ecstacy that fills their soul what tongue hath power to trace?</div>
<div class="verse">And shall that lovely Disa depart from us for aye?</div>
<div class="verse">Shall mist for ever darken Folkvangur’s vivid ray?</div>
<div class="verse">And must that bosom soft and fair against the hairy breast</div>
<div class="verse">Of the rough giant throb, and by his rugged hand be prest?</div>
<div class="verse">Shall lips, which utter tones so mild, and soul unite with soul,</div>
<div class="verse">Be soil’d by the disgusting kiss of such a goblin foul?</div>
<div class="verse">Shall eyes, whose soul-subduing rays a power resistless prove,</div>
<div class="verse">Be doom’d to contemplate a form impossible to love?</div>
<div class="verse">No! rather let Yggdrassil’s top in Nastrond’s marsh corrode,</div>
<div class="verse">Or Bifrost sink dissolv’d in dew to Ægir’s deep abode!</div>
<div class="verse">Myself, who on the brink of heaven must watchful stand in arms,</div>
<div class="verse">I can but catch a fleeting glimpse of Freya’s matchless charms:</div>
<div class="verse">But when, each morning, crown’d with flowers she o’er my bridge doth pass,</div>
<div class="verse">With fecundating smile the realm of mother Earth to grace,</div>
<div class="verse">With tenfold zeal inspired, in hand my Gialler-horn I take;</div>
<div class="verse">Its joyous tones to love of life and strength mankind awake:</div>
<div class="verse">Quitting his nest, then soars the lark towards the celestial height;</div>
<div class="verse">A thousand carols to the world proclaim with loud delight,</div>
<div class="verse">That Freya’s soul-enchanting smile hath bless’d Heimdaller’s sight.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Heimdaller’s words find no dissent: the Asars’ hearts they move;</div>
<div class="verse">And Freya’s eyes rewarded him with such sweet looks of love,</div>
<div class="verse">He blush’d like morn, when through night’s veil the day begins to break:</div>
<div class="verse">Tears glisten’d in his radiant eyes, and roll’d adown his cheek.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Heimdaller then Lok’s plan explained, and spoke: “Ye Asar high!</div>
<div class="verse">His hammer Thor will ne’er regain, unless we mystify</div>
<div class="verse">The amorous giant: as ye know, he seeks a bride more fair</div>
<div class="verse">Than those he’s been accustomed to, in his dark mountain lair.</div>
<div class="verse">Unused to females, who possess grace, beauty, symmetry.</div>
<div class="verse">To dupe the giant’s senses coarse no arduous task would be.</div>
<div class="verse">If Thor will but consent to dress in feminine attire,</div>
<div class="verse">There is a bride at once most fit to cool the giant’s fire!</div>
<div class="verse">Let Thor like Freya be array’d: to further the deceit</div>
<div class="verse">She’ll not refuse, I trow, to lend the robes and jewels meet.</div>
<div class="verse">Odin a lotion too can give of faculty divine</div>
<div class="verse">To wash off all callosity and roughness from the skin.</div>
<div class="verse">Thor then, with face as white as meal, and cheek as red as blood,</div>
<div class="verse">Will lose his shaggy beard, ’tis true, but not his hardihood.</div>
<div class="verse">Let the famed necklace Brising about his neck be wound;</div>
<div class="verse">There in exchange for Miölner a bride at once is found!</div>
<div class="verse">Before his bosom two round stones we’ll fix within his vest,</div>
<div class="verse">And there, in outward form at least, appears a woman’s breast!</div>
<div class="verse">And these when wrapp’d in scarlet cloth, at the bare sight will fill</div>
<div class="verse">With sulphur all the giant’s veins, and cause his blood to thrill.</div>
<div class="verse">A bonnet with a long white veil to grace his brows were meet;</div>
<div class="verse">And bunch of keys, tied to his waist, the bridal dress complete.</div>
<div class="verse">Lok too, as waiting-maid attired, with Thor shall bend his way</div>
<div class="verse">To Utgard’s realm: he’ll not refuse, I guess, this part to play,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then, when Thor sits upon the couch in the dark giant’s dome,</div>
<div class="verse">When bearing Miölner in their arms the black dwarfs forward come,</div>
<div class="verse">When Thrymur, drunk with love, shall place the hammer on Thor’s breast,</div>
<div class="verse">What then Thor has to do, methinks, I need not here suggest.</div>
<div class="verse">In Heimdal ’twere presumption great, by words or argument,</div>
<div class="verse">To teach great Asa-Thor the use of his own instrument.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With joy the Disar clapp’d their hands, and with each other vied,</div>
<div class="verse">Delighted with the stratagem, to dress up Thor as bride.</div>
<div class="verse">The gods indulge in hearty laugh; Yggdrassil flouts the sky;</div>
<div class="verse">Its branches green wave o’er the roof of Valhall gloriously.</div>
<div class="verse">Balder, Forsete, Mimer were absent from the Ting,</div>
<div class="verse">And mightily this favour’d Lok’s project. Drupner ring</div>
<div class="verse">On Odin’s finger dropp’d, indeed, on the grass others nine,</div>
<div class="verse">And fain, to its construction true, would warn its lord divine:</div>
<div class="verse">But the Asynior’s laughter gay banish’d from Odin’s breast</div>
<div class="verse">All scruples; so that Loptur’s guile he deem’d a harmless jest.</div>
<div class="verse">Thor did indeed remonstrate: “How? as female, Thor appear?</div>
<div class="verse">Unheard of! ne’er can I consent the female garb to wear.”</div>
<div class="verse">But Freya with her lily hand patted his cheek, and lo!</div>
<div class="verse">All scruples vanished from his breast, all wrinkles from his brow.</div>
<div class="verse">“’Tis true,” said Freya, “mortal man composed of wretched dust</div>
<div class="verse">Must by his nature ever be a victim to mistrust;</div>
<div class="verse">Must ever guard himself against the influence of hate,</div>
<div class="verse">Which ne’er the most illustrious deeds fails to calumniate;</div>
<div class="verse">But Thor in Trudvang rules; who dare his acts divine arraign?</div>
<div class="verse">Surely to aid a humorous freak his godhead cannot slain.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Young Fulla, bearing Freya’s robes, now enter’d in the hall;</div>
<div class="verse">But Odin’s hand must widen them; for Thor they were too small:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But to give him a slender waist their utmost efforts fail,</div>
<div class="verse">For he was stout, and would not move without his coat of mail.</div>
<div class="verse">Now on his breast the two round stones ’twas Hermod’s task to place;</div>
<div class="verse">At this the fair Valkyrior blush’d, and laugh’d, and hid their face.</div>
<div class="verse">Now they suspend about his neck the necklace, Brising hight,</div>
<div class="verse">With many a ruby rich adorn’d, and many a diamond bright.</div>
<div class="verse">Now to the face and neck of Thor Odin applied his hand;</div>
<div class="verse">All roughness vanish’d at the touch: white, delicate and bland</div>
<div class="verse">Became his skin; no hue remain’d, which Thor could designate.</div>
<div class="verse">Now round his brazen helm a cap with long white veil they plait;</div>
<div class="verse">He don’d his gloves, and Megingard around his girdle laced,</div>
<div class="verse">To act with force, when in his hand his Miölner should be placed.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now red they take to paint his cheek; they cut his nails; when drest,</div>
<div class="verse">A sprig of whitethorn in full bloom they fasten to his breast.</div>
<div class="verse">Now round the god travestied thus th’ Asynior young and gay,</div>
<div class="verse">Like children at a fav’rite game, delighted frisk and play:</div>
<div class="verse">“O Thrymur! gallant Thrymur!” in chorus loud they chime,</div>
<div class="verse">“Hast thou ne’er been love’s vassal, thou’lt not escape this time.”</div>
<div class="verse">To harness now and yoke the goats was Tialf’s peculiar care:</div>
<div class="verse">Then Thor and Lok in female garb ascend the golden car.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus down o’er Bifrost’s dizzy height, in Freya’s robes array’d,</div>
<div class="verse">Drove Asa-Thor; a tinge of rose the vault of heav’n o’erspread.</div>
<div class="verse">As the car pass’d, Heimdaller blew his horn in glorious style,</div>
<div class="verse">The virgins nine salute the god with fascinating smile.</div>
<div class="verse">Seen from the earth, like meteor bright the golden car appear’d;</div>
<div class="verse">This time no thunder shook the poles; no forked lightnings glared:</div>
<div class="verse">The car athwart the azure sky swift glided like a swan;</div>
<div class="verse">Therein sat Tialfe, Asa-Lok, and Thor, the giants’ bane.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></div>

the mythe. Skrymur is the frost-giant, personification of winter. Thor
reposing in the glove denotes the beginning of winter, when the thunder or
thunderer may be said to rest therein, allegorically (there being no
thunder in winter). This hieroglyph is very ancient, inasmuch as Icelandic
word <i>vöttr</i> (glove) proceeds probably from <i>vetr</i> (winter); the glove
being the part of dress particularly appropriate to and only used in winter
in those times, as the muff is still, in northern Europe.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Respecting Skrymur’s wallet, which Thor is unable to untie or
open, Finn Magnussen says: “I think this mythe is enigmatical, and
alludes to winter (the frost-giant), which may be said to prevent man from
getting his food from the earth, by envelopping it in ice.” In the prosaic
Edda, Utgard-Lok says, in explaining to Thor his magic spells, “The
wallet I gave to you, was made fast with an iron girdle;” now there is a
close analogy between the words denoting <i>ice</i> and <i>iron</i> in many of the
Gothic languages. Ex: in Icelandic, <i>is</i> (ice) <i>isarn</i> (iron); in German, <i>eis</i>
(ice) <i>eisen</i> (iron); in Dutch, <i>ijs</i> (ice) <i>ijzer</i> (iron); in Anglo-Saxon, <i>is</i> (ice)
<i>isen</i> (iron).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The ancient northmen, who oriented themselves with the help of
the mountains, figured to themselves the north as lying towards our east
or north-east. This will serve to explain the phrase, “mountains vast
which towards the north appear.” The mountains lie really towards the
east. Towards the north, on the contrary, the land becomes less and less
elevated, as you draw near the pole.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> <i>Midgard’s snake</i> is the serpent Jormundgard, type of the ocean,
which surrounds the earth (Midgard). According to Ling, a Swedish poet,
the mythe of Lok and his three offspring, Fenris, Hela and Jormundgard,
may be thus explained. Fenris denotes what is destructive or prejudicial
in <i>Fire</i>: Hela denotes the deleterious qualities of the <i>Earth</i>, in decomposing
substances and causing rottenness: Jormundgard denotes the destructive
qualities of <i>Water</i>: all these are caused by the action of <i>Air</i> (Lok or
Loptur) mixing with <i>Angurbod</i> (impurity). The amour of Asa-Lok and
Angurbod has some resemblance to the amour of the giant Typhon with
Echidna, which produced the Chimera, Cerberus and Hydra of the Greek
mythology.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The Hell of the Christians is always represented by theologians as
a place of <i>eternal fire</i>; yet in the country where the religion of Odin prevailed,
the inhabitants, from ancient custom, could not refrain from considering
it sometimes as a place of <i>eternal cold</i>. At least, the idea sometimes
breaks out in the ballads composed long after the introduction of
Christianity. In a Scottish ballad, for instance, inserted by Walter Scott
in his “Minstrelsey of the Scottish Border,” there is the following
stanza:
</p>

tells him that he had beaten and put to flight the giantesses on the isle of
Hlesey:

</div>

<p>The Author has adhered closely to the prosaic Edda in his narration of
Thor’s adventure in Utgard.</p>

<p>With respect to the two Loks, and the difference between them, it is not
a little curious to find that in the gospel of Nicodemus (one of those rejected
by the council of Nice, chap. xx, verses 2 and following), Satan and the
prince of hell are described as two distinct persons; and when Satan informs
the latter, that he has achieved for him a great conquest, by bringing
captive to his realm no less a personage than Jesus Christ, the prince of
hell, instead of thanking Satan for that service, loads him with reproaches
for his unpardonable thoughtlessness, in bringing into his dominions a
person by whom he (the prince of hell) had sustained a serious detriment,
in the loss of sundry souls, whom Jesus Christ, in escaping from hell, had
carried off with him, and who, but for that visit, would still have remained
there.</p>

<p>It is singular that this comparison should have escaped the notice, not
only of Finn Magnussen, but that of all the other commentators of the
Edda, when discussing the subject of the two Loks. I stumbled by mere
chance three years ago on a copy of the apocryphal New Testament in
German, and on reading the chapter above quoted, the idea of this analogy
immediately and forcibly struck me.</p>

effects; it is a happy idea of the poet to imagine all the serpent kind engendered
by him.
</p>
<p>
In every mythology the serpent seems to be the emblem of humidity and
its noxious qualities. The fable of Jormundgard has evidently given rise
to the supposed existence of the kraken, or monstrous sea-serpent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345a" id="Page_345a">[345]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> According to the Scandinavian belief, the half of those who fell in
battle fell to the share of Odin, and the other half to Freya. Finn Magnussen
thinks this to be a mistake, and that by Freya is meant Frigga, the
wife of Odin. The allegory then becomes more clear: Odin typifies the
heavens, Frigga the earth; the spirits of the slain ascend to Odin, their
bodies remain with Frigga.
</p>
<p>
Another very ingenious allegory lies in the nature of the nourishment
used by Odin at the banquet of Valhalla. In the younger or prosaic Edda
it is written, “The food that comes to his (Odin’s) share, he gives to his
two wolves, Gere and Freke. He himself requires no solid food, for wine
is to him both meat and drink.” In the elder or poetic Edda it is thus
written in the chapter called Grimnismal:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The warlike highly honoured</div>
<div class="verse">Father of heroes gives his food</div>
<div class="verse">To Gere and to Freke;</div>
<div class="verse">For by wine alone</div>
<div class="verse">Is the glorious Odin nourish’d.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
By this is meant, that in battle the spirits of the slain mount to heaven
(Odin), while their bodies remain a prey to wolves, and other beasts of
prey. Spirits are typified by wine, the most spirituous of all fermented
liquors.
</p>
<p>
The above quotations from the two Eddas afford, perhaps, the best
illustration of the difference of their respective styles.</p>

</p>
<p>
This adventure of Thor with the serpent and giant Hymir is recounted
in the prosaic Edda.
</p>
<p>
The story of Thor losing his hammer Miölner in the scales of the body
of the serpent Jormundgard has a resemblance to the story of Jupiter losing
his thunderbolts, and their falling into the hands of the giant Typhon,
often represented as a dragon. Typhon, in Greek, means either the giant
of that name, or a whirlpool: now Jormundgard typifies the ocean, and
Miölner, the thunderbolt. The Grecian mythe is to be found in the first
and second Cantos of the Dionysiacs, or triumphs of Bacchus, in the celebrated
Greek poem of Nonnus. These two mythes have a still closer
resemblance in their denouement, as will be seen by a reference to the
Notes of the 29th Canto of this work.</p>

</p>
<p>
Iduna represents the mild air of spring, which gives renovated life and
animation to all nature. Thiasse represents winter, and the carrying off
of Iduna typifies the disappearance of all genial warmth at the approach of
winter; her deliverance from the prison of Thiasse denotes the return of
spring; Thiasse being burnt to death in the bale-fire of Breidablik, denotes
the melting and disappearance of ice by the heat of the sun at the approach
of summer. The rape and the deliverance of Iduna are both effectuated
through the agency of Asa-Lok, who typifies time and its vacillating nature,
now impelled to good, and now to evil.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> The circumstance of Niord being given as a hostage to the Asar
pleads in favour of the hypothesis I have already given, namely, that
Niord and his children Frey and Freya were Assyrian or Persian divinities,
adopted by the Asar, and incorporated in their religion. Frey, the son
of Niord, typifies the sun at the winter solstice, and the festivities of the
new year in the pagan time were instituted to do him honour. His
father Niord presides over the winds and waves; but Balder also typifies
the sun (at its highest elevation), and Ægir is the god of the sea. The
fact is, that in the Scandinavian mythology there are <i>two</i> sun-gods and <i>two</i>
gods of the sea. The explanation of this seeming incongruity is not difficult.
Among the Asar, Balder was the sun god, and Ægir the god of the
sea; but among the Vaner, Niord was the god of the winds and waves,
Frey typified the sun, and his sister Freya the moon. When the political
alliance took place between the Asar and the Vaner, the former adopted
some of the divinities of the latter, and in consequence of this amalgamation,
Niord, Frey and Freya received suitable posts in the Gothic pantheon.
It is remarkable, that among the ancient Egyptians the sun was called
Phré. Among the Greeks, Bacchus often typified the sun, and by the
Romans he was called Liber, which has exactly the same meaning as the
word Frey, viz. <i>free</i>.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the appellation Goth was not known in Scandinavia
previous to the invasion of the Asar, and that these last assumed the name
of Goths (good and brave men), when they introduced their religion into
that country. This idea leads me also to surmise, that as long as the Asar
remained in Asia, the name Hrimthusser (frost-giant), and not Jetter or
Jotun, was applied to the evil spirits of their mythology; and that it was
not until after their grand immigration into Scandinavia, under the command
of the historical Odin, that the term Jetter or Jotun (which was the
national appellation of the aborigines of Scandinavia) was, in consequence
of the long and bitter wars between the Asar and Jetter, and of the national
hatred arising therefrom, applied by the Asar to those malevolent spirits,
who, as they supposed, assisted their enemies, the Jetter. The self-love
of all nations leads them to assume, that they are the favourites of the good
gods, and that the evil spirits are the abettors, instigators, and coadjutors
of their enemies; and even in our time, as has been wittily remarked by
Washington Irving, a number of the <i>good sort of people</i> in England, during
the war against revolutionary France, thought that <i>somehow or other</i> God
Almighty was on the side of the English government. As a further confirmation
of my conjecture that the word Goth was unknown to the Scandinavian
peninsula, until introduced there by the Asar, I cite the following
passage from a Saga, written in the Icelandic or ancient Scandinavian
tongue:</p>

<p>En dha voru dhessi lönd er Asia menn bygdu köllud Godlönd, en fólkid
Godjod. Odin ok hans synir voru slórum vitrir ok fjölkunnigir, fagrir at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353a" id="Page_353a">[353]</a></span>

medh ymisligum algerleik, og nokkura af dheim tóku menn til at
blóta og trúa á, ok kölludhu godh sin.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Translated thus</i>:</p>

<p>Then this land, which Asia’s people took possession of, was called Godland,
and the people Godjod. Odin and his sons were very wise and
skilled in many things, fair in aspect, and strong limbed. Many of their
race were men of great strength and of divers perfections, and the people
began to worship some of them, and call them their gods.</p>

absence of Iduna: all the pleasures of Valhalla are suspended. According
to Finn Magnussen, the mythe of Skada’s entry into Valhalla may be thus
interpreted: Skada here typifies the violent winds and capricious temperature
of the commencement of spring, which proceeds from winter, as
Skada does from her father, the frost-giant Thiasse. Though she enters
Valhalla with violent designs, she becomes pacified at the sight of Balder
(the sun at the summer solstice). Thus doth spring, commencing with
tempests, become appeased and calm, from the increasing heat of the sun
at the beginning of summer. The English reader will be here reminded
of the old English proverb: “Spring comes in like a lion, and goes out
like a lamb.”</p>

<i>blind cow</i>, in which Skada catches Niord, and is united to him in marriage,
is borrowed from the prosaic Edda. I can find no satisfactory solution of
this mythe; it may mean, however, that the spring weather, after much
shuffling and shifting about, settles down at last into a mild serenity and
constancy (during summer). But the matrimonial bliss of Niord and his
consort will not be of long duration. Towards the autumnal equinox,
Skada’s capricious temper will break out, she will begin her mischievous
pranks again, and set winds and waves by the ears as usual. Skada’s
catching Niord by the leg in the game of blind man’s buff, may mean the
force of a tempest, which sometimes lifts men off their legs.</p>

being in Valhalla, he would have risked falling into the hands of Hela.
According to the author of this work, Œhlenschläger (who has made
Starkodder the subject of a most interesting tragedy), Oluf’s death was
revenged by his son Frode Frækne, who clove Starkodder’s scull in single

<p>In the metre I have adopted for this Canto, I have introduced occasionally
anapests, for the sake of greater variety.</p>

<p>In this Canto the poet has diverged considerably from either Edda, and
has boldly and felicitously sketched a plan of his own, into which, however,
he has interwoven ideas taken from three different Cantos of the poetic
Edda: viz <i>Harbard’s song</i>; <i>Alvismal</i> (discourse of Alvis); <i>Skirnisfor</i>
(journey of Skirnir). In the first, Harbard’s song, it is Thor, and not
Skirnir, who enters into a dialogue with Harbard, whom he meets at the
fiord. In the second, Alvismal, the subject of the Canto is a dialogue between
Thor and the dwarf Alvis (all-wise), wherein the latter makes a pompous
display of his learning, by giving definitions and synonymes of <i>earth</i>,
<i>heaven</i>, <i>wind</i>, <i>fire</i>, nearly in the same manner that Skirnir does in this
Canto. In the third, Skirnir’s journey, wherein Skirnir is sent by Frey to
propose marriage to Gerda, are mentioned the ferocious dogs which
guard the dwelling of giant Gymer, the father of Gerda.</p>

</div>

<p>In this Canto the poet has diverged considerably from the chapter in the
poetic Edda, called the Skirnisfor, which treats of the same subject. In
Œhlenschläger’s poem, as has been seen, Skirnir makes use of the most
gentle and insinuating means of persuasion to induce Gerda to give ear
to his proposal; and the stratagem of Frey’s likeness conveyed from the
brook into Gerda’s basin is entirely the poet’s own <i>concetto</i>, and it is, I
think, a very ingenious one: whereas, in the Edda, Skirnir makes use of
the most terrible threats and sinister predictions, in order to force Gerda to
accede to his master’s wishes; and at length he succeeds in terrifying her
into submission: among other threats, which are not of the most decent
nature, he tells her that she shall either be wedded to a frightful three-headed
Goblin of the Hrimthussar race, or pine a maid, tormented with the
most violent desires, which cannot be gratified.</p>

<h3>NOTE TO THE TWENTY-FIFTH CANTO.</h3>

<p>In the original, the metre of this Canto is written in imitation of one
much used in the ancient Danish ballads, which, admitting a <i>refrain</i> that
seems to have little or no connection with the substance of the ballad, continue
it in every stanza throughout the piece. Here are <i>three different
refrains</i> used in succession throughout the whole Canto, except in the two
last stanzas.</p>

<p>The subject of this Canto is taken from the celebrated chapter in the
poetic Edda, called “Ægir’s feast” or “Lok’s scurrility,” to account for
the origin, object and meaning of which, has puzzled all the commentators
of the Edda. The most simple <i>éclaircissement</i> thereof seems to be that
of Finn Magnussen, who thinks that the author of it may have been a sort
of Scandinavian Lucian, who wished to throw a sly ridicule on the gods
of his country. Œhlenschläger has varied, augmented, and embellished
the subject with imagery and embroidery of his own, and has omitted certain
parts of somewhat too obscene a nature.</p>

is probably the explanation of this mythe. Frey signifies the sun;

Scandinavians was highly poetical and metaphorical. A ship was often
compared to an animal, and its masts to the horns of the said animal; the
masts were made fast with iron rings round their circumference, and this I
take to be the surest etymology of the word Hringhorn or Ringhorn.
The ships of the Vikings were long and deep, and had usually but one mast.</p>

<p>I have adopted for the translation of this Canto a metre, alternatively
trochaic and anapestic.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_101_101" id="Footnote_101_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> It was the custom, at the marriage ceremony of the ancient Scandinavians
in the pagan time, for the betrothed to swear fidelity to each
other, in touching the hammer of Thor. May not this account for the
ceremony of marriage at Gretna-green being always performed by a blacksmith?
The lowland Scots are of Scandinavian origin, and they have
preserved many a custom and many a superstition of their ancestors.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_102_102" id="Footnote_102_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_102_102"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> Respecting Hrugner and Mokkurcalf, please to consult the Alphabetical
Catalogue.</p>

</div>

<p>The following explanation of the foregoing mythe is given by the Swedish
poet Ling:</p>

<p>The loss of Thor’s hammer, and its remaining <i>eight miles</i> under
ground in the hands of Thrymur the frost giant, denotes the impotence
or inactivity of the <i>electrical fluid</i> during the eight months’ winter of
the northern regions. The invitation of Thrymur to Freya typifies the
struggle of nature at the approach of spring, to renew its vitality.</p>

<p>Stuhr’s opinion of this mythe is much the same as that of Ling.
He thinks it to be a hymn in honour of spring, typified by Freya. Thor
borrows Freya’s attire, i.e. in spring the electrical heat resumes its force.
Thor travels with Loptur (the air) to Thrymur. They are furnished
with a copious repast; i.e. at the approach of and by the influence of
spring, the unfruitfulness of the earth ceases. When Asa-Lok speaks of
the <i>eight nights</i> of longing passed by the pretended Freya, it means the
progressive changes undergone by the polar atmosphere during the eight
winter months, before the heat finally obtains the mastery. The immense
appetite and quantity of mead drank by Thor denote the absorption of the
earth’s vapours by the electrical fire of summer, and the death of Thrymur
denotes the total disappearance of winter. It is scarcely necessary to
remind the reader, that Miölner, the hammer of Thor, typifies, almost
everywhere, thunder, or the electrical fire and its effects.</p>

<p>In the Greek poem of Nonnus, called the Dionysiacs, or Actions of
Bacchus, we find a mythe having no doubt the same signification as that
of the Thrymsqvida. Jupiter at the approach of winter loses his thunderbolts,
which fall into the hands of the giant Typhon. He recovers them
in spring, by means of a stratagem of Cadmus, and soon after makes use
of them to discomfit and slay the giant Typhon.</p>

<h3>NOTE TO THE THIRTIETH CANTO.</h3>

<p>In the original this Canto is written in <i>terza rima</i> as follows.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry fraktur">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Da Thor nu sti̱lle sad, og endt var Kampen,</div>
<div class="verse">Da steeg en langsom Rög af Jeṯṯeblodeṯ,</div>
<div class="verse">Og hvid og tyk oplöftede sig Dampen.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Da ski̱aelved Loke brat og tabte Modeṯ, etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides the difficulty of the <i>terza rima</i>, it is a metre not very well
suited to the genius of the English language. I have, therefore, given my
translation of this Canto in blank verse, following the example of Carey in
his version of Dante.</p>

<p>The subject of this Canto seems taken partly from some strophes in the
Voluspâ, and partly from the Vaftrudnismal, which are the names of two
of the most important chapters of the poetic Edda.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_103_103" id="Footnote_103_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_103_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> Gugner, name of Odin’s lance.</p>

</div>

<p>This Canto does not require notes, but as it may amuse the reader to
compare the history of the destruction and reproduction of the world with
the account thereof given in the Edda, I here subjoin some extracts from
the two chapters above mentioned, following Finn Magnussen’s translation.
I think the reader will remark some resemblance between certain parts of
this Canto and certain parts of the Apocalypse. The battle between Thor
and the Serpent Jormundgard is not unlike the combat between the Archangel
Michael and the great dragon; and the palace of Gimle, the future
abode of the blessed, presents an image of the new Jerusalem.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
